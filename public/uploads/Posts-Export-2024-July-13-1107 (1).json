Make sure\nthat you are using cold water while washing. As we said earlier, the hot water\ncan shrink your t-shirt more. You can either use the washing machine or just\nhand wash. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are\nhandwashing, then remove the excess water by squeezing the wet t-shirt. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step-2</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now put the t-shirt on a clean\ntowel.

And at that\nsituation, it's easier to remove. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the stains are fresh, it\nwill be easy to get rid of it. But when it's dry and not new, it will be tough\nto remove. And so, soaking is important. When you wash the cloths, the first\nthing you do is to soak it. Just like the same thing, you also have to soak it\nwhen it's about sperm stains. It will make things easier and remove the stains\nperfectly. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3.

Well, it depends on the elements of\nthe detergent. You have to know it first whether it has optical whitener and\nenzymes or not. And if it has then you should take the necessary amount of the\ndetergent according to it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking less and need-able amount\nof detergent is useful because if you use too much of it then the stains might\nnot be washed out properly and it also can cause over-siding. So make sure you\nwon't use lots of detergent in a hurry. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4. Know your elements and details</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every human body has a different\nkind of amount of different elements inside it. That's why it's necessary to\nknow the elements of it first. Sperm is basically a protein. There are also\nlots of other ingredients that are present with it. But the protein is the\ntoughest one to deal with. That's why it's tricky to get rid of a stain when\nit's a stain of sperm. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to clean it, you can use hydrogen peroxide. It's known for <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/how-to-remove-stains-from-leather-car-seats/\">removing stains</a> of cloths.

But the deep cleaning process after a certain time will take a bit longer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Deep <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/how-to-keep-house-clean-when-dog-is-in-heat/\" >cleaning a house</a> mainly depends on some of the things which are related to the house. Details of the rooms, kitchen, bathrooms and other additional things are important. The more the amount of stuff in a house, the more time you will need to deep clean that house. Besides, the number of people also creates and changes the time period of deep cleaning. The presence of people or the size of rooms in the house creates differences. Let's dive into the deeper explanation so that you will be clearer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":138,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-long-does-it-take-to-deep-clean-a-house.jpg\" alt=\"How long does it take to deep clean a house\" class=\"wp-image-138\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How long does it take to deep clean a house?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it's about cleaning up your house, it's very important to know how to do that. And for that, you need to be cleared about it. And once you are done with all the knowledge, then it will be easier to calculate the exact possible time to finish the deep cleaning of your house. And when it's about deep cleaning, it is become more important to be cleared about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people might have questions about the time period of deep cleaning. It actually depends on how you are going to do that and what are the conditions of the house. There are other things which are the reason for the changing of the time period of deep cleaning. For getting more information, check the details below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Condition of the house</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Different houses have different interior and conditions. The\ntime period for finishing the cleaning process depends on the condition of the\nhouse. There are lots of rooms, a kitchen, washrooms, bathrooms and also other\nplaces in a house. And the conditions of those areas identify how much time it\nwill take to finish the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the conditions of certain places become very bad and the\nother places are not too dirty then it won't take too much time. On the other\nside, if the whole house got very messy for some reason, then it will take more\ntime than before.&nbsp; Basically, it has no\ncertain time limit for ending up the deep cleaning process. It depends on the\nconditions of the whole house. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So at first, before starting the cleaning up thing, you have\nto be cleared about what kind of condition your house has. After knowing fully\nabout it, you can now calculate the exact time of ending up the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Amount of people in the house</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is another thing to be concerned about. The total time\nwhich you will need to finish the process depends on the people also. If you\nhave more people in your house, you have to do more cleanups as the house will\nbe messier. Having lots of people in a house makes that house messier and\ndisorganized.&nbsp; </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Imagine you invited people to a party at your house last\nnight. The party is over but you have to do cleanups now. When there are lots\nof guests at a party, it's natural that the house will be a mess. And for that\nreason, it will take lots of time to deep clean that house. You need to give\nmore time when it's about deep cleaning. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's how you cannot guess the actual time period of\ncleaning a house. It totally depends on the events and the number of people in\nthat house. And if the number of people is small and there won't be lots of\npeople around the house, then it won't take that much time to that deep\ncleaning process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Having animals or not</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, the thing is important whether you are having animals\nand sorts of pets or not. It is because the thing is quite depending on how\nlong the process will take. And if there is any pet or any kind of animal in\nyour house then it will take more time to finish all the cleaning things. And\nwhen it's about deep cleaning, it will definitely take more time than the house\nwithout any pet. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The houses which have animals are becoming very messy. It is\nbecause the pets are always messy in nature. And if the pet is living with you\nin your house, the house will be disorganized and very dirty for sure. So,\ncleaning all those messes will take much time than the other one. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Amount of rooms</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The amount of rooms and other stuff is as important as the\nnumber of people in a house. The more the number of rooms is increased, the\nmore time you will need to deep clean the house. And if you have a lot of\nrooms, a kitchen, storeroom, bathrooms, living room and other stuff in the\nhouse, then you will need more time to complete the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you have fewer rooms, a small living room, fewer\nbathrooms and other stuff, then you will need less time to clean. All of those\ncleaning things depend on the number as well as the space of that house. Both\nthings are equally important for the time period of deep cleaning a house. It\nis because if you have a large area in your house then you will take more time\nto clean it up. And if you have a house that is small, you will need less time.\nSo, all of those things depend on the structure of the whole house. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Kids or no kids</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They say kids are ANGEL! But when you are going to clean a\nhouse where a kid is present in, you will realize kids are a mess and obviously\nit's natural. It is because they are innocent and they don't know how to keep\nthe places clean. And thus they create the place a messy one. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, if you're wondering about how much time it will take to\ndeep clean a house, you need to look at the number of people in your house and\nthe presence of a child. If you have a grown-up kid or a baby, you will have to\nmaintain a lot of things. And if a kid is present in any house, it will\ndefinitely create a mess. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's the reason, having a baby will increase the amount of\nyour work and thus it will take more time if you are going to do a deep clean\nin your house. So, being clear about it is important to figure out the time\nperiod of any work. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using cleaning tools or not</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are going to do the deep cleaning process with smart\ncleaning tools, it will help you more. Thus it will take less time to finish\nall the cleaning. And if you are not using those modern cleaning tools and just\nusing your regular tools then you will take more time to finish for sure. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Such as, if you use a vacuum cleaner for cleaning dirt,\nwashing machines for clothes and other advanced cleaning ingredients for better\nresults will help you to finish all the cleaning work fast. And when it's about\ndeep cleaning, then these things will help you more. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you are not using those cleaning items but just use\nthe simple things to make the house cleaner, then you need to save more time\nfor deep cleaning as it will take more time without the advanced tools. So, the\ntime of this cleaning process is also depending on the product which you are\ngoing to use while deep cleaning the house. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Tips for deep cleaning a house faster</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. For removing stains, you can use baking soda, lemon and\nother kinds of special ingredients that help to remove those stubborn stains. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2.

These methods will be useful for you as it will reduce the pressure of yours to clean it properly. So, let's check what the incredible methods are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Baking soda</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, we talk about baking soda. We all know how amazingly the baking soda works for removing any kind of stain. It is also great for removing burnt grease from the surface of the pan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for applying it, you just need to take the burnt pan and sprinkle soda on the burnt area. Let it sit for a few minutes. You should add some water on it so that it can soak properly. After a while, scrub it off and you will see how incredibly the stains come out from the surface.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it can be a bit pricey but it works like magic. It removes stains from both the stainless steel and the other types of pans too. To get a better result, soak it for a long time before scrubbing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Vinegar</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we know that, vinegar is an acidic product that is used for cooking, and even for some household activities. There are 5-20% acetic acid that the vinegar contains. And this amount of acid helps to remove stains easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, vinegar is available in almost every house. That's why you can choose this element if you don't have a cleaner around you or you want a better result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, it's useful for stains. For getting better results, you need to pour some vinegar on the burnt place, and leave it for 15-20 minutes. After that, take a scrubber and scrub it nicely until the stains come out. It's easy and simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Soak and scrub</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter what element you use, if you don't soak it then you won't be able to get rid of the stains. That's why you have to soak the ingredients on the pan, and then do the next process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soaking is an ancient procedure that is used by almost all people. It's effective for removing tough stains in an easy way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, scrubbing is not enough. It just does half of the work. You also need to scrub the stained places after completing the soaking process. That's how you can get the effective results.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4. Bar keepers friend</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bar Keepers Friend is a stain cleaning element that has been used since 1882. It's effective for reducing and removing stubborn stains. It's a powerful cleanser, and it's specialized for cleaning this kind of stuff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's actually good stuff, and it works very impressively. And to get the impressive outcome, you need to use it properly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using it is an easy process. You need to apply this powder-textured element just like the baking soda. Simply sprinkle the powder on the stained area and add some water to soak it nicely. After 5-10 minutes, scrub the places and wash as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can see it takes all the grease away, and it works very quickly. Overall, it's a thumbs up for this element.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>5. Ketchup</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's basically an experimental process you can say. Ketchup has an acid that can remove the stains of the pan. You just need to apply the ketchup on the places that are burnt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if we compare it with the previous elements, then we won't recommend you this as it will take much time. And if you want to clean the entire frying pan with this then it will be tough to clean because the cleaning process of it is slow. But if you don't have any alternative around you then you can use this as an experiment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>6. Heat and scrub</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Heating is another effective way to clean the frying pan surface. All you need to do is, take the burnt pan and pour any of the elements like baking soda, vinegar, salt, or things like that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, start the flame. You can mix a little amount of water with it. Heat the pan in a high flame for a few minutes. Once you are done, then turn off the flame and scrub it as before. Make sure the heat won't hurt your hand. Because of scrubbing, you will see the burnt grease coming off the surface. And when you will scrub all over the surface nicely then wash it with plain water and leave it for air dry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>7. Baking powder, sea salt, vinegar</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can mix baking soda, vinegar, and sea salt all together. It can provide you better results. And for doing it, take a bowl and mix all the ingredients to make a paste. Then apply the paste on the stain and soak it for some time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, scrub it well, and wash the surface with water. You have to make sure that you soak the pan with that paste properly. That's how you can get the better results easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>8. Cream of Tartar</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cream of Tartar is another element that is used for cleaning. It can <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/how-to-clean-burnt-grease-from-bottom-of-frying-pans/\" >clean the burnt pans</a> too. It seems good how cream of tartar removes burnt grease.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ingredient is called cream of tartar, but it's not in a cream-based formula. It's a powder-based element that you can use for reducing stain. And for doing it, use this powder and cover the pan with it. Add some water and then scrub it perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you use it, you can see some changes but it cannot remove all the stains. It works slowly and thus provides average results. You might get a benefit like the bar keepers friend but it has to be soaked for a longer time to get that result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can see through the methods that almost all the methods have the same procedures of cleaning. However, we will recommend you to use baking soda and bar keepers friends. These two are amazing. But baking soda can be a bit expensive for you. At that time, use a bar keepers friend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But in an overall sense, you can apply any of those methods. And we assure you that you won't be disappointed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

It will clog both the areas to the hairbrush and the drain of the bathroom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like the same way, it will also clog the area of the commode if you flush hair down the toilet. The reason is, hair breaks down slowly. That's why you can absolutely say that doing this isn't a proper thing that you often do. You absolutely cannot do that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, hair is the most common element to clog the pipe. That's why doing it is not safe. Further, when the long hair goes into the toilet, it creates a web that can easily stop any type of flow. That's how the toilet gets clogged easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's so easy to make a ball of hair and throw it into the toilet. But if you realize what the outcomes will be then you will not do that at all. The hair and the other materials can stick together easily and help to make a clogged pipe. That's why we will keep saying repeatedly that flushing the hair down the toilet is not a good option to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Will hair block the toilet?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you knew earlier that the one thing that can go through the toilet is human waste. Many of the people flush toilet papers into it but it's also an inappropriate thing to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, hair is a thing that can easily clog the toilet. It can clog pipe downstream of the toilet too. Further, there is another thing that can be problematic when you are flushing hair down the toilet. And that is the hair down the drain that can make all kinds of havoc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hair is a biodegradable property, and that's why it can leave down there for a longer time than other elements. It also can clog the outer filter and that's why you need to dig up and clean out the filter nicely. So, it's clear that the hair can clog the toilet and block that line.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What should you do then?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's proved that flushing hair down the toilet is an inappropriate idea. That's why you have to be careful especially when you are in the bathroom. It is because flushing it down will completely clog the flowing area. It will make the water flowing stop, and it might bring a lot of trouble to you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what should you do then? You can do two things to avoid this stress. Firstly, you can throw the hairs away. That's the simple thing to do. The other thing is, you can compost it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, you can try to compost the hair. Yes, you should know that hair is compost-able. You can compost it to get rid of the clogging. Many of you might not know that it's a good source of nitrogen. And that nitrogen is good for soil. That's why you can use hair for composting instead of wasting it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for doing that, you should simply mix the hair in the compost pile. You can also add the other elements with it and compost it. Make sure you do the process by adding a small amount of elements because that will be easier to compost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you don't find the composting procedure useful, then you can simply throw all the hairs away. The best place to throw it is in the trash bin. That might not be environment-friendly but it will surely help to get rid of the clogging of the toilet. That's why you can surely apply any of the two options and thus you can stay away from the trouble.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What can you flush down the toilet?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are not all the things that you can flush down the toilet. There are some things that you can flush. It's important to know what the things are that can be disposed of through flush.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the right thing is going down the toilet, it won't harm anything because it will flush away and nothing can be clogged up. And all the watery things that are being flushed, eventually go to the rivers and sea. So, it will be a beneficial thing that we got from nature.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if the things are not flushed and put it in the bin then it can harm the normality of nature.

It won't create any difficulties to the commode, and thus these kinds of things can be flushed down easily.

But doing that isn't the right thing. Those elements can clog the commode area and the other areas too. And there are several things such as, any kind of wet wipes like makeup wipes, baby wipes, toilet wipes, and many more. Most of the people think that flush those wipes down is fine. But it's not a right thing even if there is written \"flushable\" on the cover.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, any kind of cotton pad or cotton wool is also an inappropriate property to flush down. There are also some elements like cleansing pads, dental floss, cigarette butts, toilet roll tubes, sanitary napkins, medicines, nappies, tampons, plasters, and these kinds of things cannot be flushed down the toilet at all as it can cause damages to the water flow of the toilet, and that made it harmful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Wrap up</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We often don't realize what we are flushing down the toilet. Of course, it's an obvious thing to be an absent-minded human in that case. But it should be noticed what you are flushing down through the water. It is because there can be some inappropriate things that shouldn't be flushed down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's the reason you should always be aware of that thing to avoid the upcoming trouble.

After soaking it, start cleaning using an old thin toothbrush. You will see the dirt can easily come out from the inner corners of the brushes. That's the result of the soaking procedure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Wiping out</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After finishing the deep cleaning, the next step is to wipe the brushes out in a nice way. Take the wet brushes, and wipe it out using a towel or tissue paper. It can help the brushes to remove the excess water. You should do the wiping procedure in a dabbing movement and that will help the brushes to get rid of the excess water easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use another technique for drying it out.

But make sure the heat of the dryer won't be that much high that the material of the brushes can't take it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if the brushes are waterproof or made of plastic then, you don't have to do anything. Just wait, and it will dry out automatically. And if the brushes are made of wood then, you need to follow the drying procedures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 7: Repeat</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After doing all the procedures, then you need to recheck if there is any dirt remaining on the brushes or not.

But many people think that using baking soda is harmful. But let me enlighten you. it's the most effective way to clean any kind of dirt or stain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you still don't agree with it and don't want to use this method then you can also follow some simple tricks to keep your combs cleaned.

Let's see what the different procedures are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3># <strong>Traditional way</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1: Dusting</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First take a broom and <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/how-to-clean-baseboards-with-dryer-sheets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clean the baseboards</a>.

Try to purchase that broom that has longer handles. That's why you don't have to bend over while doing this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do it in the right way, first sweep the baseboards a couple of times. After that, collect all the dust and put all of that in a bin. Make sure you dust off the areas nicely to get into the next procedures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong><em>Step 2: </em></strong>Vacuum</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you have a vacuum, you don't need to worry at all.

You can also do it by hand, and that's why you can clean the way you want.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for doing it, you can use baby wipes. Take baby wipes and wipe the places appropriately. Make sure you will wipe out the corners too. There should be no dirt remaining on the surface.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, you can simply use thin clothes to do this. Take the cloth and soak it in water. Then take it off from the water and remove all the excess water as well. After doing it, do the same process just like the previous descriptions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Make the solution</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After cleaning with wipes, now it's time to make a solution that can deeply clean the baseboards. And the traditional way to make a cleaning solution is easy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to make the solution, all you need to do is to take a bucket and add warm water into it. After that, add your preferable cleanser, and mix it well. Make sure the cleanser is totally chemical free.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Further, there is a soap called Dawn dish soap that has a quality that can easily remove grease of baseboards, sinks, floor, dishes and places like that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can add Dawn dish soap or just the regular dish-washing soap into the water. You have to take 4-5 drops of Dawn dish soap into the warm water and mix well before you use it. That's it! The homemade cleaning solution is ready to use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5:&nbsp; Cleaning</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are done with making the solution, now you have to use it in a proper way.

There is a UV light bulb that helps to grab the insect. The high voltage electrical wire is used for attracting the bugs into it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a plastic or a metal cage that is placed inside the zapper. This cage is used for storing the insects and kill them. Besides, ultraviolet light is being emitted from the fluorescent light bulb. It will help to attract insects easily. Just like they are attracted to the flower patterns because the UV light reveals it. And this technique is also used in the zapper that ensures all the insects are going inside the cage and stuck in it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you might have some confusion whether it works or not. The answer is, YES! It works. You don't have to take any doubt about its effectiveness.

Leave the laces for a day to air dry properly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Loosen the dirt</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next step will be the cleaning of the shoe. And the first step should be the cleaning of the dirt that shows on the upper level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you find loose dirt that can easily be cleaned out then you must do it. And for that reason, you need a brush. You can use any kind of leather brush. But if you don't have that kind of brush then you can use an alternative. And the alternative can be any other kind of brush-like toothbrush.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take that brush, and gently dust off the dirt from the surface. Make sure the brush has soft bristles. That will help you to get the dirt off easily without doing any harm to it.

But make sure you won't put much pressure on it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After cleaning the surface completely, now wipe them out with another dry microfiber cloth and leave it for some hours to dry it out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Clean the soles</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cleaning the soles is as much important as cleaning the entire sperry.

Remove it by applying a counterclockwise motion. That's how the shoe will look shiny.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 7: Shoe buffing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, only polishing is not enough. If you want to give your sperrys an extra shine then you need to buff it out. It's also an important step for your shoes to look gorgeous and new.

It's a kind of perennial and aromatic creeper. It's called an evergreen plant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Generally, it's known as creeping charlie, ground-ivy, tunhoof, alehoof, catsfoot, and many more. Creeping charlie is a mint type of plant. As you know, plants from a mint family can be used for several purposes. It can be used as a fresh herb, and you can eat it in salads. But creeping charlie is not edible at all but still a member of a mint family.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But it's used for making beer.

Well, you might face a dilemma whether you should use it or avoid it. And for getting into a conclusion, you need to know about the effectiveness of borax.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Borax is a kind of thing that is basically sodium tetraborate. It's used for reducing the creeping charlie. But the best part is, it won't harm the grass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As creeping charlie is an invasive perennial leaf, borax can form a toxic spot to the area that you spread the entire borax mixture. And that's how it can kill the creeping charlie. So, yes, it's true that using borax is an excellent idea to reduce and totally kill the creeping charlie weed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for that, you need to apply borax mixture when the leaves are just starting to grow. But make sure you won't use it excessively. It is because if you use it frequently then it can damage the grass too. The proper amount of using it should be once or twice in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Get Rid of Creeping Charlie with Borax</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":290,\"width\":280,\"height\":415,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-to-Get-Rid-of-Creeping-Charlie-with-Borax-1.png\" alt=\"How to Get Rid of Creeping Charlie with Borax\" class=\"wp-image-290\" width=\"280\" height=\"415\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Removing creeping charlie is not a difficult task to do. It's even easier than removing the other kinds of plants. All you need to do is to take the right steps. Though borax has an absolute weed reducing formula, it also has some side effects. But using it appropriately can harm the grass less.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make a perfect solution in an easy way, let's take a look at the ingredients, and the methods that we are going to describe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>For making the solution, you will need</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>10 oz. Twenty Mule Team Borax</li><li>4 oz. (1/2 cup) of hot water</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1: making the mixture</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, you need to mix all the things to make a solution. You need to take warm water and borax. Mix all the ingredients together. After that, dilute in 2.5 gal. water. It will be easy to mix the ingredients.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you face any difficulty, then you can use a blender and blend it for 20-30 seconds. That's it. It will mix all ingredients together in an easy way.&nbsp; But it will be better if you use an old blender and avoid the regular one. The reason is, the borax can mix with the food when you will use the blender later for food preparation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Pour it</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are done with all the mixing and making, then you need to take a nice spray bottle. You can have a regular one if you have one in your house or you can get it from a store. Then pour all the mixture in a spray bottle and start the spraying process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Spreading</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you have to take the bottle and spray it all over the garden area.

Of course, you can do it. But if you want to know the details of cleaning brushes just like the professionals do, then keep your eye on the further reading.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Well, for doing it, the things you will need are:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Dirty brushes and combs</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Gloves</li><li>Some large boxes</li><li>Measurement cups</li><li>Pedicure brush</li><li>Dish soap</li><li>Clean towels</li><li>Brush Cleaner (use another comb instead)</li><li>Cleaning solution</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1: Take all the hair out from the brush</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first step should be the cleaning of all the hair out from the brushes. The reason is that it will make the entire process easier. You cannot clean the brushes properly if the hair is stuck into the bristles of the brushes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, old hair that is stuck into the brushes can spread infections. Though in a salon, a brush is used for different purposes and interacts with different hair of different people, that's why cleaning every hair from all the brushes is important.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to clean the brushes and the combs, take the brushes and untie all the hair. You can use a brush cleaner that can be found online. Or else, you can take another comb to remove the hair easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you find the hair being much stubborn and it's being hard to take them off, then you can use scissors. Cut the hair off with the scissors and take all the hair away and throw it in the bin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: scrubbing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next step is scrubbing. After getting rid of all the hair from the brushes, now it's time to scrub them well. You can use any kind of ready-made scrubber to clean them nicely. The reason for scrubbing is, it will dust off almost all dirt that is present in the corners of the bristles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, cleaning it in that way will make the entire process easy for you. To clean the hair brushes professionally, this step is necessary for deep cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want a deeper cleaning finish, you can use a toothbrush. Yes, it's a DIY solution that we are suggesting but it's totally up to you whether you want to apply the technique or not. Otherwise, you can take any kind of scrubber or stiff brush in order to do the same thing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Further, make sure you won't push the scrubber too hard on the brushes. It might damage or break the bristles of it. Be gentle and allow the scrubber to clean the area properly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Pre-wash</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time to pre-wash it. Pre-washing means you need to get all the brushes together and make these ready for cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for cleaning it, you need to take a bucket or a large box so that the bushes can be soaked well. Put all the brushes into the box and add water.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you pour a lot of water that it can totally cover the brushes. The box should be full with water. After that, add any kind of liquid cleanser into it. You can also use dish washing liquid soap. The results will be the same. And then, let the brushes into the mixture for about 7-10 minutes. That will be enough for getting done with the pre-wash.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other thing that you should be careful of is the timing. You need to be particular about it. 10 minutes for soaking is enough. And if you will keep it longer, then it might bring different results. And if you soak it for a shorter time then it will be tough to clean easily and quickly.

We will let you know different ways of cleaning the coffee maker. Keep reading the below pieces of write up to know the procedures in brief.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":450,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-to-Clean-Braun-Coffee-Maker.png\" alt=\"How to Clean Braun Coffee Maker\" class=\"wp-image-450\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Clean Braun Coffee Maker</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can clean the Braun Coffee Maker using a variety of ways. However, we will let you know about the most effective procedures below. Check out the first procedure from below:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Washing the Pot</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Coffee pot is the part of the coffee maker that needs to be cleaned regularly after brewing the copy. Cleaning the coffee pot is pretty easy, especially when cleaned immediately after brewing the coffee. You can use dishwashing soap and warm water to clean the pot. Cleaning the container will ensure that the glass is clean and look new for a long time. More so, it will also resist any accumulation and burn in the glass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can give a deep clean to the pot once in a month. It is imperative, especially when you need to use hard water for preparing coffee. Hard water can build a deposit inside the coffee pot, which can make the container look ugly. Such deposits typically do not come off with the usual soap and water solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vinegar can help you to remove the hard water deposits from the coffee pot. Simply add tablespoons of vinegar in the pot and then pour water to the maximum level. Now close the container and shake it around 20 seconds. Then remove the solution from the pot and rinse it with fresh water. If there are any excess residue or vinegar left on the pot, you may clean them off with warm water and soap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Cleaning the Detachable Parts</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost all models of the Braun Coffee Maker feature different removable parts, such as the brew basket. The brew baskets can hold the coffees that outflow from the filter while brewing. These coffees can easily mix with the fresh brews and make the taste bitter. So, it is also essential to clean the removable parts, including the brew baskets. You can easily wash the brew basket using the hot water and soap solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, you can also clean the brew basket inside a dishwasher for easier and efficient results. The parts also require a thorough clean within a while. Fill the device with a vinegar solution and pull the valve to clean the below parts where coffee drips from. This procedure will take a little time, but it can ensure an efficient result by washing the entire piece.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Washing the Interior</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of the other parts of the machine that you need to clean include the water reservoir and the inner tubing. However, you may not entirely wash the parts efficiently using the soap and water solution. Instead, use a 1 part vinegar and 2 part water solution to clean these components once in a month.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Running such a clean will bring out any cooked coffee particles, mineral deposits, hard water deposits, etc. from the parts. Make sure to brew some pots of regular water to remove the vinegar solutions left inside the machine entirely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Descaling Process Recommended by Manufacturer</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Descaling the coffee machines means removing the mineral buildup inside the machine. When you use the usual tap water while brewing the coffee, different minerals like calcium, magnesium, etc. from water pass through the device. These mineral materials can cause limescale in the machine's heating component. Such deposits can make the coffee taste bad, and also decrease the lifespan of the device.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Descaling the Braun Coffee Maker is pretty easier when compared with the coffee makers from the other manufacturer. There is a built-in mode that lets you automatically descale the device. It also indicates you about the times to descale with an LED that lights up solid green. Here are the actions that you require to follow to run the descaling procedure:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Start with detaching the charcoal water filter holder along with the charcoal water filter. You will also need to remove the gold-tone permanent filter.</li><li>The put the carafe in the right position on the keep warm plate. Now click on the Clean button to start the procedure.</li><li>If the green LED starts flashing, then it means that the process has started. You can start the descaling program while the LED is flashing by pressing on BREW. Make sure to be fully ready before beginning the process as you cannot stop it once started.</li><li>The Green LED will stop when the descaling program is completed. You can remove the carafe and clean it thoroughly with fresh water to get rid of the residue.</li><li>Now fill the water reservoir of the coffee maker with 12 cups or a full carafe of freshwater. Then run two complete brew cycles to flush off the stubborn deposits. Make sure to use cold water during each cycle.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Generally, it will take around 45 minutes to finish the cleaning cycle along with rinsing. You may run the cycle several times to find the best result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Maintenance Tips to Keep Your Braun Coffee Maker at Its Best</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want to enjoy the fantastic taste of freshly brewed copy from the Braun Coffee Maker, then implement tips from now on:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Clean and descale the coffee maker device regularly to ensure the better taste of coffee and efficient performance of the machine.</li><li>Offer a thorough clean with vinegar solution once in a month to resist the buildup and deposits in the coffee maker.</li><li>Follow the given instructions in the user manual to brew the coffee as well as for descaling.</li><li>Turn off the machine when it is not in use. Doing so will not only reduce energy usage but also prolong the lifespan of the device.</li><li>Clean the carafe as soon as possible after preparing the coffee. Leaving the part uncleaned with coffee will make it unclean as well as develop ugly stains.</li><li>Replace the required parts once in six months to ensure the proper taste of the coffee.</li><li>Don't use the detergent or cleaning solution that is marked safe for the device. You may use the specialized coffee maker machine detergent for safe and efficient cleaning.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you see above, cleaning the Braun coffee Maker machine is not that hard. More so, it doesn't require frequent cleanup. If you want to keep enjoying the taste of freshly brewed coffee from the device, you should clean and maintain it periodically in the correct way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

It will be better to use a quality soft bristle brush that is made of cleaning the leather. Also, try to go for a rubber bristled brush instead of the nylon one for comfortable and safe cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step-2:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you will need to prefer a cleaning solution with water and mild dish soap for farther cleaning. Dip a microfiber cloth in the solution and then sweep the shoes with it. Apply gentle pressure in a circular motion to get rid of the scuffs and residual dirt. Try to complete the step quickly. That is because making the leather surface excessive wet can cause the fibers less supple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Never use other cleaning solutions like saddle soap on the shoes as it can break down and damage the leather of the shoe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step-3:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have performed the above measures, then it is time to dry the shoe.

Using a proper leather conditioner on the shoes will ensure a long lifespan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apply the conditioner using a soft cloth on the shoe leather. Let the shoe absorb the moisture for around 10 to 20 minutes. Then utilize a dry cloth to eliminate the excess moisture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 5:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this step, we will polish the shoes to make them shiny.

Polishes are available two variations, which are wax and cream.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cream polish is a better choice for retaining the shoe's color at its best. On the other hand, wax polishes are suitable for making the footwear shiny. Make sure to test the polish at first by applying in a small amount. Don't use it if you see any discoloration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 6:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now use a soft microfiber cloth again to buff the shoes.

Eyewear glasses are something that just cannot clean with any fabric. Using different clothes for cleaning glasses instead of the microfiber cloth can damage the glass surface. More so, it can push the dirt and dust more in-depth into the surface, which will eventually blur. On the other hand, using the wrong cloth for cleaning the glass will also scratch and scuff the lenses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The microfiber cloths are specially designed for cleaning the glass surface without causing any damage to the lens. It consists of millions of fibers in a smaller area, making it useful for reaching the tricky glass surface to pick up any dust or grime with one sweep. More so, the clothes are positively charged, which makes it attract negatively charged dirt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That means physics also supports the effectivity of the microfiber cloth for cleaning the glasses. So, never attempt to use any other types of fabric for cleaning the lenses without microfibers. Sweeping the glass lenses with other clothes will make the dust go deeper. If you don’t have lost the clothes that came with your glass, you may use a microfiber towel for cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Wash Microfiber Cloth for Glasses</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Microfiber cloths are not like the usual clothes, as we mentioned so many times earlier. There are different ways of cleaning the glass cleaning cloths. Below, we will explain some of the best ways of washing microfiber clothes as well as some best practices:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Rinse the Cloth after Every Use</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most important to maintain the microfiber cloth properties is to clean by rinsing every day. The cloth can collect all the dirt and debris from the glass surface every time you use it. And, this stuff is not going anywhere but staying on the cloth. Using the cloth without cleaning for several times will make it dirty. And the dirt can scratch the lens if used with the dirt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dirt and grimes also make it harder for you to clean the cloth. So, it is good to clean the microfiber cloth by rinsing in the freshwater after every time you use it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Use Warm/Lukewarm Water While Washing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using warm water to clean the <a href=\"https://www.explainthatstuff.com/microfibercloths.html\" class=\"rank-math-link\">microfiber cloth</a> will give you a better result than using the cold water. The heat of the water will help remove the dirt and grime quickly by loosening the fiber's grips. Ensure that you are not using hot water, as it will cause impairment in the microfibers, making them useless. Some brands also recommend using nothing but cold water for cleaning clothes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Don’t Clean them with Other Clothes</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You shouldn't clean the microfiber cloths with the other varieties of fabric in your house. As the microfiber clothes pick and gather the dirt, they can also affect the other laundry items. The little microfibers in the cloth will get clogged and cause lint, making the cleaning project worthless. The same thing goes for the laundry bags. So, it is better to clean the microfiber clothes separately. However, you may clean the glass cleaning cloth with the other microfiber cloths and microfiber towels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Use a Mild Dish Washing Liquid If Required</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You may want to give a thorough clean to the microfiber cloth. If so, then use a mild dishwashing liquid for the cleaning process. Never think of using the powder detergent as it may leave residue in the cloth even after cleaning. More so, if you are using the dishwashing liquid, then use a chlorine bleach-free solution. That is because bleach can cause damage in filament to the microfibers. It can also reduce the positive charge of the cloth, making it less useful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Washing Microfiber Cloth in Washing Machine</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, you can clean the microfiber cloth using a washing machine without any issues. However, make sure to use the appropriate gentle liquid detergent in the device. The cleaning solution should be bleach-free and don’t include any fabric softener. The fabric softener can also reduce the ability of the microfiber cloth to pick dirt. Clean the fabric separately and don't use hot water while cleaning in the washing machine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Drying the Cloth</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It doesn't matter which procedure you use to clean the microfiber cloth, make sure to dry it properly after the cleanse. Drying the microfiber cloth adequately will ensure long-term usability. It will not wash a lot of time to dry the fabric as the microfiber cloths dry pretty quickly. Don't attempt to use a dryer for quicker drying as you may end up damaging the fabrics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How Long Can Microfiber Cloth Last?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the benefits of microfiber cloths is that they are usually more durable than the other varieties of clothes. As per some sources, the clothes can survive up to 500 washes without any issues. That means you can use the cloth for around two years on moderate uses. However, the information may not go with all the varieties of microfiber cloths in the market. Besides, some manufacturers can also deduct the quality for a cheaper price.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Glass lenses are pretty sensitive, and they can easily get damaged if not handled carefully. The microfiber cloths can help you extend the glass's lifespan by keeping it clean. It is crucial to keep the fabric free from dirt and grimes to use it for a long time. Hopefully, you will comprehend how to clean the microfiber cloths correctly after reading the article.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

And if you want to clean the stove and make it like a new one then you have to know about <strong>how to clean glass top stove burnt on plastic.</strong> So, get the steps well and then apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for doing this, things you will need are:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Knife or a spoon&nbsp;</li><li>Plastic scraper (use razor blade instead)&nbsp;</li><li>WD-40&nbsp;</li><li>Soap&nbsp;</li><li>Baking soda</li><li>Acetone nail polish remover&nbsp;</li><li>Soft cloth&nbsp;</li><li>And water&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Cooling Down The Stove First!&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First step will be the cooling down the stove. It is because the stove will get hot while cooking. And you cannot do any cleaning process on that hot stove.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, it can be harmful if you try to do it with that stove. It can burn you anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, try to leave it for some minutes or an hour until the stove cools down completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Peeling&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And when the burner is cooled down properly, now it's time to peel the plastic off from the stove. At that stage, you might not be able to peel off all the plastic.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, try to do this as much as you can. That will help to do the next steps easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Scrapping Away&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take a knife for scrapping. A butter knife will be better for doing this. It can scrape the plastic away in a mild way. And that's why it won't damage the texture of the glass stove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, you can also use a spoon if you have no butter knife around you. It works the same way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You just need to scrape it gently. And make sure you won't make any scratch on the glass of the stove.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Soaking&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take WD-40 and spray it all over the area. Now, let it be there for some minutes. That will help to soak properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But, if you don't have that, then you can also use olive oil instead of it. That will also be beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soak it in the same way. And leave the stove there.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Scrape Again&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's time to rescrape it. At that time, take a razor blade and with the help of it, you can scrape easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have to make sure of your holding angle. You need to hold the razor in a straight way. So, take the blade and hold it as straight as possible. This will help to avoid scratching on the surface of the stove.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, maintain that and steadily scrape the plastic out of the stove. You will see, this helps to get the burnt plastic out without harming the texture of the glass.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Baking Soda Solution&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After being done with the scrapping, you can now use a solution for getting a better result. And to do that, take baking soda and sprinkle all over the surface that you want to clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you know, baking soda works magically, especially on the tough stains. And when it's about cleaning the burnt plastic on a glass stove and try to make it like a new one, you can use it for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, spread baking soda all over the area and let it be soaked for a generous amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 7: Scrub Off&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, you need to scrub those soaked areas after getting done with soaking. And for doing this, you will need a soft cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And with it, scrub those areas in a gentle way. The main purpose of it should be the cleaning of the plastic. So, make sure it won't do any kind of scratch on the surface.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And by considering these things, scrub the places, and clean all over.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 8: Repeat&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can consider these <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/deep-cleaning-house-checklist/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">steps as the proper cleaning process</a>. You can repeat these steps if you see any stain or plastic that isn't scrubbed off yet. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, at that time, repeat as many times as you want. All you need to be satisfied with the results. That's why do the procedures again until all the plastics are removed well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 9: Nail Polish Remover for finishing&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can stop at the previous step. But you can do one more additional thing. And that is to use nail polish remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It will help to make the stove cleaner than before. All you need to do is soaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this stage of cleaning, the maximum part of the burnt plastic is removed. So, you don't need to give a lot of effort now.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just take the remover and apply it to soak. Take a cotton ball or a soft cloth or whatever soft textured thing you like, and then soak it with the liquid remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, apply at the places where you want a specific cleanup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, if you use the acetone nail polish remover before, you must knew that it can evaporate quickly. That's why you must keep using it often to keep the moisture. So, keep reapplying it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 10: Scrub Again&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After soaking, you have to scrub it again. You can use a regular scrubber for that. And then, start scrubbing it all over the area in a gentle way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That will help to get the leftover plastic out from the stove in an easy way. And no scratches will be created because of this technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 11: Cleaning&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point, you will find most of the places without any kind of plastic on it. So, it will easier to do this. Now, it's time to do ultimate cleaning. And for that, use a mild soap to clean it perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And you will need warm water with it. Mix these things together, and clean all the areas of that stove. Make sure there is no oil, or any other residue exist.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And in that way, you can get a properly cleaned surface. And after that, you can take another soft cloth, and clean it again by soaking it with water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 12: Drying&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you can wipe it out to make it completely dry. Also, you can air dry it. Just leave it for some hours and it will be dry naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's all it is.

So, make sure you spray to those areas in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, make a solution of baking soda. And to do that, you will need a bowl.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take baking soda and water in that bowl. Add a generous amount of water to make a thick mixture.

So, you need to search about the quality of the material that is stained.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to check it, you can see the label of that cloth. Almost every product has a label that describes all the details of that particular cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, there could be some washing instructions too. So, you can understand how to wash it and which procedure will be the suitable one for removing salt stains. That's why you have to know about the cloth, and then get the further procedures done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Removing excess salt</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time to remove the upper level salt first. And if it is wet, then you need to take it the basin.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then Soak it for a few minutes. After that, gently rub the stained area to get the excess salt out of the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if the stain is getting dry, then soak it in water properly. You can use cold water for this purpose. After being soaked for a while, now you need to rub the stained area with a brush to take the upper level salt out from the cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's how you should remove the excess salt easily. And if you do it, then you can get the stain out of the cloth too. Then, it will be much easier than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Soaking&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time for soaking. This part is important because if you soak the area nicely, then it will automatically let the stain come out from the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, that's why soaking is important. And for soaking, you should add detergent into it. Take water and detergent powder and make a nice and foam-like mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should take detergent according to the amount of clothes you are washing. If you have a lot of clothes, then you will need a lot of detergent. On the other side, if you have less amount of cloth, then you will need less amount of detergent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, make that mixture nicely. And after that, take the cloth and dip it into the mixture. Let it be soaked for a few minutes or about an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you soak this way, chances of setting the stain on cloth will be decreased. That's why you need to remove the stain, but first, you need to soak for a generous amount of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Use vinegar&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At that point, you can add vinegar into it. Or, you can also make a solution of it. That will give you the better results for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all know that vinegar has excellent elements to take the stain out. It will be easier to remove the stain if you soak it into a vinegar mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for making the solution, you need to take one part of vinegar and mix it with three parts of water. Now, take the cloth and dip it into the mixture. You can also use cotton pads to soak that particular area. You need to soak it for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soaking in the solution is necessary, but you need to follow the instructions while doing this. So, you have to be careful about this. And according to that, you have to soak it well in the vinegar solution to get rid of the salt stain completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Washing&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After getting done with soaking, now it's time to wash all the dirt and detergent residue out of it. So, you need to wash those clothes in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You already know that vinegar helps a lot to remove stubborn stains easily. So, after soaking in the vinegar solution, you don't need to give a lot of efforts to that cloth. All stain will surely go away.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You Just need to wash it to get rid of the residues. You can wash it in washing machine. Or, you can also wash it by yourself. Rinse the entire cloth with cold water and then use detergent to wash it completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you wash it in a gentle way. Do not use a brush at this point. The reason is, the stains will already gone at that time. And it won't be much dirty. So, just wash it in a humble way to get a detergent-free cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Drying&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After washing the cloth perfectly, now you have to dry it out properly. It is because if you don't dry it properly and it will still be wet then it can have an odor. That will not be a good option to wear or use again.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, it is about hygiene. So, if you dry the cloth well then it will be germ-free.

There might be the watermelon seeds, juice of it or even small pieces of the fruit that creates stain on the cloth easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to remove these, take the cloth, and gently clean the upper level stain and all the residue with the help of a clean cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There could be several things on the cloth. But one thing you have to make sure and that is to avoid rubbing the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And with a gentle motion, get the dirt out of the fabric.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2:  Basic Rinsing   </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you have to rinse the cloth using plain water. It will help to wash off the upper level dirt easily. Also, it will help to minimize the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why you should rinse the stained area as soon as possible. And doing it will be easier to get rid of the stain properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You don't have to use any ingredient or do any scrubbing at this point. You just need to gently rinse it with water to get the excess fruit out of the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use two kinds of methods for this. First, you can do blotting. You can blot the stained area with a paper towel after cleaning it with plain water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other side, you can clean it with water by holding the cloth as well as the opposite side of the cloth under a running water so that, the dirt and the juice of watermelon can come out from cloth easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another thing you need to be careful about is that the stain won't spread to the other parts of the cloth. So, be aware of the thing while rinsing.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Use Stain Remover</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After rinsing off the cloth, now you have to do the main cleaning to remove stain completely. And to do it, use stain remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you have to take careful steps while using it. It is because it can work differently if you won't be careful about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For using it properly, take the cloth and use enzyme-based stain remover on that area. Take a generous amount of that remover to use in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take dishwashing liquid or normal detergent to apply on the surface. Make sure you use enzyme-based product because it is good to break down the stain in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Soaking</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it’s time for soaking. This part is important because you can get the results according to the soaking process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you are done with applying the detergent and stain remover, now you have to focus on the soaking. Take the cloth and leave it in a bowl to soak it nicely. You have to let it be soaked for about 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And while soaking, you need to make sure of another thing. And that is to ensure that the stained area will be soaked properly with the detergent and the stain remover solution. That's how you have to do the soaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Washing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are done with soaking, now you need to do washing to completely clean it. And for doing that, you can use washing machine.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you have to check the details of the materials of that cloth first. The reason is, not all types of clothes have the quality to be washed in a machine. So, must see the labels, and then wash it in a machine if it is washable.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if it is not washable, then you can wash it in a basic way. Hand washing will also work well. So, take the cloth and rinse it once to get all the excess out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, rinse and wash again to get the perfect cleaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Add Bleach</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you apply the previous method, you can hope to get rid of the watermelon stains. But if the stain is still not gone yet, then you can apply another technique to the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for that, you will need to make a solution. Take oxygen-based bleach, and mix it with warm water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take the cloth and dip it into the mixture. One thing you have to careful while using bleach, and that is the measurements and quantity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are going to use bleach, you need to be very careful. Take a generous amount of bleach, and add hot water to minimize the side effects of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after being sure about all these things, now you can allow the cloth to submerge into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 7: Soaking&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after apply the mixture, you have to let the cloth to soak. And you will need much time for doing this.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Generally, you should soak the cloth into the bleach mixture for about 3-4 hours. It will be better if you do the process at night, and let it be soaked overnight.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 8: Washing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are done with soaking, now you can see the stains come out easily. At that time, your application is almost done.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you need to wash it well to get the entire bleach out of the fabric. And to do the washing, simply take the cloth, and rinse it with water for once.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, you need to wash it again. That will ensure the perfect washing of the cloth. And you will be sure that no residue of the solution will be present in it. So, wash it well with room temperature water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 9: Drying</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not just washing is enough. You have to dry the cloth well after washing. It is necessary because if you won't do it then the cloth might leave a bad smell. Also, it might create germs that hampers your hygiene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, drying is also important. And to dry the cloth well, you can use a dryer. But not all kinds of material of cloth can take the electric drying process. And it might harm the cloth texture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's the reason, you need to be sure before doing it. But you can also use another natural technique that will cause zero harm to the fabric. And that is to air dry it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also dry the cloth for a short time under the sun. That will make the cloth germ-free and hygiene.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 10: Repeat</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These steps are enough to remove the watermelon stains from cloth. But last thing you need to know that you should repeat the methods if needed.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Repeating those processes is important only if you find that the stains are not gone yet.

A butter knife or a spoon will be better for this purpose. Take the knife or the spoon and slightly take the dried pulp out of the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to be very careful while doing it.

Fresh Juice Stains</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":548,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/How-To-Get-Fruit-Juice-out-of-Clothes.png\" alt=\"How To Get Fruit Juice out of Clothes\" class=\"wp-image-548\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the juice stain is completely fresh, then it will be easier to remove it than before. You just need to follow some basic rules properly and you will be all set to do the stain removing.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, to do the removing, let's check the method and see the steps well. That might give you a clear note about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1:  Flush with Cold Water</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, you need to take the upper level stain out of the cloth. And to do it, you just need to use water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take the cloth and dip it into the cold water. Then rinse well to get rid of the stains. You can also rub it a little to take the stain out.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another thing you can do. And that is to take the cloth under a running water. And the upper level stains will be gone in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Make A Solution </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, make a solution for removing stains. And to make it, you will need dishwashing liquid or any kind of liquid soap and vinegar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a bowl and mix these two things together. Make a watery solution of it. So that, it will be easier to soak.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Soaking </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it’s the time to soak the cloth into the mixture. That's why take the cloth and dip it into the bowl of that solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soak it for a couple of hours and check if the stains are gone or not. If you see the stains are not coming out, then you need to soak it for a longer time. But if you see no stains on the cloth, then get into the next steps.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Lemon Juice Application </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the previous solution won't work, you can use another technique. And that is to use lemon juice on the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lime juice has some good enzymes that can remove spots and stains. So, using it will surely bring some good results for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after using the juice and soak it for a few minutes, you need to take the cloth and leave it in the sun to get rid of the stains.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But one thing you need to consider and that is the fabric. Not all types of fabric can take the lime juice process. So, you have to know about this before doing this step.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Washing </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After applying all the techniques on the stains, now you have to wash all the solutions. And to do it, you will need plain water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just take the cloth and rinse well with the normal water. Make sure no detergent or any other kinds of ingredient will exist on the cloth. So, be careful while doing this. All you need to do is to wash the cloth properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Drying </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After finishing washing, now it’s time to dry it properly. The reason is, if the cloth is not dry properly, then it will be unhygienic. Also. It might leave a slight odor.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why you have to dry it well. Air drying will be perfect for this purpose. So, leave the cloth for air drying. You can also dry it in the sun for better hygiene.

And what the method will be and how it works, let's check!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First step will be blotting. You need to start with blotting the stain by using a clean cloth. And then, try to absorb as much juice as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Blotting is important because you can get all the juice out of the carpet and protect the stain from spreading.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other thing that you should be aware of and that is, you must not scrub the stained area. This might damage the fabric. Just try to lift the stain with the help of a clean cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use any kind of cleaning solution. Just spread it all over the stained area to soak. Make sure you choose a good quality stain remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, you can take lime juice as a solution. Take a spoon and spread the juice to the areas well. And make sure you cover all the areas well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have to make sure that the stained fabric is&nbsp; absorbed with the solution you are using.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you need to let the carpet be soaked properly. You all know that, soaking is important. The reason is, it can take the stain out of the fabric.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The more you soak, the easier the removing process will be. So, make sure you take a plenty of time while doing the entire procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And in that way, soak the carpet well to make sure you won't need to do more to remove the stain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you can gently rub it to get the stain out properly. But make sure you won't rub it too harsh or do any scrubbing process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do that, you can use a spoon. Just a spoon can remove the excess solution and stains too. So, instead of a scrubber, you should use a spoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, it won't damage the fabric of the carpet. And you can rub the stained area in a gentle way. So, rub it in this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 5 </h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing you need to know is, you can also use ammonia or hydrogen peroxide if you think the stain tough to remove with natural home ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These two elements work in their best way possible to remove any kind of stains and spots. Especially, if the juice is of cranberry, then the stain will be tough. And, at this point, you can use any of these Ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But make sure you won't use these elements on wool kind of fabric. Otherwise, you can use it by maintaining some techniques of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 6</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time to wash the area. And to do it, you cannot pour water on it. So, what should you do?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At that time, you will need a spray bottle. Take cold water in that bottle spray all over it to remove the excess.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take another clean cloth and blot with it. This will help to remove all the solution, and the water that are inside the fabric.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after that, leave the carpet there for air drying.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 2: Clean with Detergent and Vinegar </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all know that, vinegar works great for removing any kinds of spots and stains. And detergent is useful for cleaning any kind of fabric in an easy way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, you can guess by it that both ingredients are special ones that can remove juice stains and make it a cleaned one in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You just have to know the procedures and how all the ingredients should be used. That will be enough that you should do at first. So, let's get started!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, you will need a cloth to blot the juice and take out of the carpet. You can also use a paper towel to do this process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, to do it in a proper way, take a paper towel or a clean cloth and blot up as much juice as possible. Make sure, you won't apply any kind of scrubbing motion while doing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just take the cloth and start blotting in a gentle way. You have to make sure that you will take away as much juice as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason is, it will be much easier to remove all the stains if there will be less juice to make more stain. So, blot up the juice in this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it's time to make a solution for the removing. The first solution will be made of detergent and warm water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a generous amount of dishwasher detergent and add a cup of warm water into it. If you can use non-bleach detergent if you have. It will be better for the fabric than the regular one.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after making the solution, now apply it onto the stained area. Let it be there for a few minutes, and then again blot it up with another clean cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After doing it, now you need to make another solution of vinegar. It will be better for the stains. And to make it, you will need about half cup of vinegar and 2-3 cups of water. Make sure you use regular white vinegar for better outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, mix it well to make a solution. Take a spray bottle and pour all the mixture into it. Now, apply this mixture onto those affected areas well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after that you need to let it be soaked for a while. Then, take a cloth and again blot up to absorb all the excess solution from the carpet.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are done with the solutions, now you need to wash all the areas well. You can use a spray bottle and spray all over the area with water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, clean all the water with a cloth. And if the stains are still visible then repeat the steps once again. And for the finishing, leave the carpet to dry in the air well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 3: Use Baking Soda and Shampoo&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't have vinegar or you don't want to use that, then baking soda can be an alternative of this.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is also a great element to get rid of any kind of stains and spots.

So that, the stains won't set in, and it will easier to remove.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why you need to remove it first. And for that, you will need a clean cloth or a paper towel. Start blotting with the cloth and take as much liquid as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take a spray bottle to spray lukewarm water on that stain. After doing that, you should blot up the liquid again. You need to use a clean cloth or a cloth just like before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And you should use a slight pressure to the carpet to while blotting. That will help you to take the juice out quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take a bowl and make a mixture of shampoo and lukewarm water. After that, you need to apply the solution directly to the stained area. Make sure the area is soaked in that solution perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take a paper towel and blot the area again. You have to soak the excess water well. And in that way, you can take the solution out of the carpet and you will see, the stains are coming out slowly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time for the second solution. And for making that, you will need baking soda. Take baking soda and mix it with water.

You will see the stains are coming out perfectly and that's what you want.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 5</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you cannot see any changes then you should repeat the methods again. If you think the area needs to wash again to remove the juice stain completely, then you can surely repeat the processes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 6</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are done with all your procedures and there's no stain remaining, then you should go for the final step.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that is to dry it well.

But you can remove the stains if you give some effort to it. You need to know <strong>how to remove oil stains from silk saree</strong> and all the other stuff too.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, let's check all the procedures and the steps well to learn it properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;Ingredients you will need:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Baking soda</li><li>Salt</li><li>Liquid soap&nbsp;</li><li>Cornstarch&nbsp;</li><li>Talcum powder&nbsp;</li><li>Distilled water&nbsp;</li><li>And dry cleaning kit&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Prepare&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, the first step will be preparing all the ingredients and equipment too. And if you do it then the entire procedure will be much easier.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do that, arrange all the ingredients that you are going to use. Also, take the alternative elements too. It is because you might need it if the stains don't want to go.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, take the harder equipment like bucket, spoon, brush, and even dry cleaner and arrange them too. Make sure you won't face any problem or any interruption while doing the process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, arranging all the things in a place where you are going to remove the stains is necessary. Also, take that stained saree and place the stained area on a table.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have to make sure if the other parts of the stain won't mix up and get wet. Otherwise, it will cost you more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Make the solution&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After arranging all the things in place, now you have to&nbsp; make the solution first. It is because if you do it, then it will be easier to execute the entire process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, at first, mix some absorbent ingredients like baking soda, salt and cornstarch together. These three powdery things need to be mixed together to apply on the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So that, it can absorb the oil easily. Any one type of element will be enough. But mixing the three ingredients will give you better results for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Apply&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, apply the mixture on the affected area well. And you have to make sure that the entire stained area must be covered well with that mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And in that way, you need to apply it in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Soak</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After applying the powdery thing on the area, now you need to leave the saree for soaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you won't use any kind of water on it. The entire area should be covered with only this dry solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you can also add talcum powder with it if you want. It also helps to soak as much oil as possible. Just apply and cover the stain well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And then leave it for several hours. The more you soak, the better the result you get. So, keep that in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Brush off&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several hours, it's time to brush off the powder. And while doing that, make sure you won't do it in a tough way. Otherwise, the fabric of that precious silk will be damaged.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just be gentle and do the scrubbing in a gentle way possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though the material is delicate, you need to be careful about it. And after fully brush the residues off, you will see the oil stains start fading away.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And when the stain is almost gone, you need to stop doing the scrubbing at that time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Repeat</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you see no such difference, then you need to repeat the processes. Generally, new oil stains are easy to remove. The reason is, the stain is still wet and isn't settle on the fabric well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, it will be easier to remove. But if the stains are old, then it will be difficult to remove. But that doesn’t mean it is impossible. You can try this method on this and get better results.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if the stains are tough, you can do two types of things. The first one is to dry cleaning it. You can do it in laundry by any professional cleaner.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though it is a delicate fabric, we won’t recommend this thing to you. But if you have a dry cleaning kit, then you can do it at home. It will be better to remove stains quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the second suggestion is to make a liquid solution and apply it. And the element is liquid dishwashing soap. Pour some of it on the stains and let it be soaked for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, clean it with water. You can use distilled water for better results. It won't make any water spots on the saree. So, make sure you do it if your stains are stubborn and tough to remove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 7: Dry</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The final step will be drying. You can use any kind of dryer for this purpose. Also, you can use hair dryer too if you have no dryer available around you. Both will work in the same way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you do dry cleaning then doing it with the dry cleaning kit will be better. But if it is the other method that you are following, then you can dry using a hair dryer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure the heat doesn't cause any damage to the silk. And if you want any suggestion, then we would recommend you to sun-dry it. As it is silk, drying in the sun will be appropriate than any electric dryer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, the heat of the sun will take away all the remaining stains too. So, it will be the best option for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Pro Tips</strong> For Removing Oil Stains From Silk Saree</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Don’t be too harsh but be gentle on silk fabric&nbsp;</li><li>Take much time for soaking, and it will be the best if you soak it overnight&nbsp;</li><li>Sun-dry is effective but make sure it won't be for too long&nbsp;</li><li>You can take only the stained area and tie it so that, it will be easier to work with that part that is stained&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid using water if possible&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Verdict </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Silk is a classic and delicate material of fabric.

And these products have a whitening agent to clear the stains and make it whiter than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, that's why it is a nice option to steadily reduce the braces stains, and make it whiter.

And that is enough. Do it regularly to get a good outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3>Method 4: Avoid Stains</h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The better thing is to avoid stains than to remove it after having it. The reason is, removing process is tougher to do than to avoid having stains in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several ingredients occur stains on the teeth easily.

And if you cannot totally ignore them, then try to take it in less amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, there is a bunch of food like some fast-food such as burger, pasta, pizza, and even some other kind of food like curry, especially red curry can make stains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, if you want to avoid stains on your braces, then you must avoid these kinds of foods. Try to have any alternative food that has fewer colors in it. So, it doesn't make any stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not only the colorful food, but those who smoke can also make their teeth stained quickly.

Fortunately, the answer is yes! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coke is often touted as a miracle cleaner for oil stains. But is it really effective?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It contains carbonic acid, a weak acid, but strong enough to remove dirt and oil from surfaces. Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to remove an oil stain with Coke, simply pour some Coke onto the stain and scrub it. The carbonic acid in the Coke will break down the oil while the Coke will remove the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Depending on how stubborn the stain is, you may have to repeat this process several times. Once the stain has been removed, soak the area in soapy water for a few minutes to remove any residual Coke.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should test any stain on an inconspicuous area before you use Coke on it. While Coke is an effective cleaner, it can damage some surfaces as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How to Remove Oil Stains from Concrete with Coke?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it’s time for us to go through the process of removing oil stains from a concrete floor or asphalt driveway using coke.

Pour the coke over the oil stain and scrub the area using the scrub brush.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might have to use a lot of Coca-Cola if the oil stain is large. And don’t use a wire brush as that could leave scratches on the concrete floor.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next step involves having patience and waiting for half an hour or 40 minutes. During this time, the coke will get soaked into the concrete.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you may be aware, Coca-Cola is a highly acidic beverage. And that’s why it can easily break down oil particles in the oil stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then mix a quarter cup of bleach and half a cup of laundry soap with 3 liters of water. And take a mop and dip it into the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Squeeze out any excess liquid from the mop and start moving the stain with it. And don’t forget to wear gloves while doing this.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 5:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After mopping for some time, the Coca-Cola that was poured on the stain should get cleaned away.

These chemicals are specially made for removing oil from different types of surfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just use a scrub or a brush to scrub the oil stain and simply pour some water over it afterward.

And the stains will be removed perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other thing you can do is to soak it in warm water for some time. And then, apply the stain remover. That will increase the chances to remove the stains more.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After soaking it for several minutes, you need to scrub it. And for doing that, using a toothbrush is a good option. Tale that brush and scrub in a mild way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you don't do it harshly. It will ruin the cloth texture. Do it in a gentle way until the stains start fading away.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 6: </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are done with scrubbing, you need to wash it off.

And then let it dry in the sun for a better result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 2: Hydrogen Peroxide&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all know that hydrogen peroxide works great on cloth while it's about removing any kind of stains.

Use a spoon to do it appropriately. It will ensure the better result as it won't help the stains to spread all over the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you need warm water to soak. But make sure the water is not that much hot that it damages the texture but hot enough to remove stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, take hot water and soak the cloth well in it. Soak it for a few minutes or an hour.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After being properly soaked, you need to prepare the solution of it. You can use a detergent solution and soak in it. But if you want to skip that step, you also can do it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pour some hydrogen peroxide on the stains. You need to cover it with the solution well. So that it helps to provide you a better result.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, soak the cloth with peroxide for about 1-2 hours.

Scrub the areas with the brush so that you can get the stain-free area.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can repeat the process if you want. If you won't find the desired stain-free cloth, then repeat the entire process again. It will surely provide you the better service of all.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 7</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you see the changes and the stain-free cloth, you need to wash it now. You can do it with plain water. This time, you won't need any warm water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wash as usual and then hang the cloth to sun-dry it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 3: Lemon Juice&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lemon juice is another ingredient that you can use for a better removal. It also works as a stain removing agent that you can use for fast removing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should know about the proper techniques of it.

And when you know there is ketchup and it can ruin the entire cloth, then you need to find a way to take it out.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And with the help of a spoon, you can take the wet ketchup out of the cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take a bowl and squeeze lemon juice on it. Get a proper amount of juice to soak the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take the cloth and cover all the area with it.

And then, sun-dry it as usual.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 4: Vinegar&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also use vinegar instead of using lime juice. Both work in the same way. But as we said before, you just need to know about the process of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason is, if you know the process, then you can work accordingly.

You need to do it properly because a good outcome depends on proper application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soak the cloth with vinegar solution for a few minutes. You can also soak the cloth with warm water before applying vinegar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That will be better for getting a proper stain-free cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Scrub it with a toothbrush to get the stains out quickly. So, scrub it for a while. And then, wash the cloth with normal water. Dry it in the sun for better hygiene.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 5: Liquid Detergent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The basic method would be the detergent method. Almost all people use this technique and get better results.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't have any of the ingredients we mentioned before, then you can simply use this one.

But you need to apply the most effective one of all.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It totally depends on the situation, and also the material of it. Know the details of <strong>how to remove chapstick stains from clothes.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chapstick includes a lot of thick gel formulated ingredients. And that sticks to the cloth in an easy way. So, it will be quite tough to remove the stains of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, you can remove it if you take some simple yet effective stuff. Let's see what the procedures are, and how it works.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 1: Laundry Detergent</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first method that we are going to share with you is the basic detergent cleaning method. You need to know the entire procedure of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's how you can clean, and remove the stains in a proper way. If you made a disaster, and all the chapstick made a stain on your cloth, then this method will solve your problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let's see what the procedures are.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, you need to take out as much chapstick as possible. And for doing that, you need to take the cloth. And get the upper level chapstick out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use a paper towel to do it. And that's how you need to take the chapstick out of the cloth first.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next thing will be soaking. Take a bucket and add warm water in it. Soaking the cloth in warm water helps to melt the chapstick easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, do it by soaking into warm water. But make sure the water isn't too hot. It should not be that hot or not that cold. You can also check the label of that cloth, and set the temperature according to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the stain is dry, then use a scalpel and take the stain off. You can also use a spoon or knife to do the method. But make sure all the dried chapstick is coming out in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h4>Step 4:</h4></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you can do two types of things. You can make a solution of detergent, and apply on the stains.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, you can directly pour any kind of liquid detergent or laundry detergent, and water, then soak. Both methods work in the same way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apply any of the methods and keep the cloth for soaking. You have to make sure you soak it for a good amount of time. Otherwise, the stains might not be totally gone.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 6:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After done with the soaking, now, you need to scrub it a little. Do not scrub too harsh to damage the fabric. Just be gentle and scrub the places by using an old toothbrush.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 7 :</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The final step will be the rinsing. You need to rinse the places well to get rid of the detergent residue. And then, air dry it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 2: Stain Remover</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other useful and simple method is to use stain remover. When you see the previous method isn't working out, then you can switch it to the stain remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is easy to use and you surely get effective results for sure. That's why you need to use it to get rid of the chapstick stains.

Take a knife or the back of the spoon and scrape off the dried chapstick out of the stains first.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also wipe it out if the chapstick is not dry enough yet. Just take a paper towel or wet cloth, and wipe the areas as well as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After doing that, you need to soak the area just like the previous method. You will need hot water for this. And that helps to get rid of the stains quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do it correctly, take a bucket and pour hot water on it. It shouldn’t be too hot, but much hot to melt the chapstick stains. And let it soak for 15-20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take it out of the water, and do the next procedures. Take any kind of remover that you could find at any store. And apply to the stained areas well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, allow it to sit for some time. Then, use a toothbrush to scrub the places in a gentle way. And when you are done with the scrubbing, rinse the cloth with cold water to take the excess solution out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The final step will be getting out of the excess water by squeezing it, and allow the cloth to air dry. Sun dry will be appreciated if possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 3: Bleach</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the people use bleach as a cleaning agent. And when you are having tough stains like chapstick stains, then you can use bleach on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But one thing that you must be careful about is if the cloth is able to take the bleach or not. And that's why you should check the label of that cloth first, and then use it according to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, without any further delay, let's get into the details first.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just like the previous methods, you also soak the stains into warm water if possible. But if it is not, then you should avoid it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you are using bleach, the soaking method is not required. But you have to be sure you use the proper amount of bleach for getting a better result.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apply chlorine bleach on the stains, and cover the stains well. But if the fabric doesn’t allow it then use color bleach. It will also give you the same outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time for soaking. And for doing it, you need to take at least 15-20 minutes to soak it properly. After that, you can get to the next procedures.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>See if it removes all the stains or not. If not, then you can scrub for better results. And after doing it, rinse it, and wash the entire cloth in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, allow the cloth to air dry or sun dry if possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h2>Tips For Chapstick Stains From Clothes</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Do not use too much hot water&nbsp;</li><li>Have much time to soak the stains properly&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid scrubbing too hard, and for a long time&nbsp;</li><li>Use gloves while using chemicals or bleach&nbsp;</li><li>See the label of the cloth before using bleach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Verdict&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are the things that we have described to you.

There are some basic but useful methods that you need to know. The methods are:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Baking soda to soak the stain&nbsp;</li><li>Remove with vinegar water</li><li>Laundry stain remover helps more!&nbsp;</li><li>Liquid detergent to wash out well&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see, there are four different methods you can use to remove chapstick from your clothes, you can choose any of them that is available.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All you need is proper instruction. And to have a complete idea, check out the detailed description that we are going to show you. Let's see the four different methods and the entire process of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Baking Soda To Soak The Stain </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first method is the baking soda solution. Baking soda is an ingredient that has good properties to soak all the grease of the chapstick.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's how you can get the stain out of your cloth. But first, know the proper way to use the soda. And to know the exact way, let's see the overall method step by step.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. The first thing will be the application of baking soda. Sprinkle some soda on the stains and let it sit for some time. You need to take a proper amount of it to cover all the stains properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. After that, take a stiff brush to scrub the area well. And when you scrub the dry baking soda on the stained places, you see the stains start fading away. The reason is the soaking process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Keep repeating it until you see most of the stains are coming out. And when you see the differences, then stop doing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. After doing the scrubbing for a few minutes take all the soda out of the cloth. And then wash it in a detergent solution. That's enough to get a stain-free cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Remove With Vinegar Water</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another method that you can apply is also easy. And for doing it, you need vinegar. You can use white vinegar as it's generally available in the house. But, if you can you should choose the dark one.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason is, it removes stains effectively. So, decide what you can do and then apply according to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter what ingredient you choose, you need to know the basic technique of using it. And when it’s about removing chapstick stains, you should follow some rules. So, let's see what these are.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. First, you should make a solution. And to make it, you need to mix vinegar and water. That's the two-ingredient that you need to make a liquid solution to apply on the stains.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. So, apply the solution to the cloth. Cover all the places well. Also, shake the mixture well before applying.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. After properly applying the mixture, now you need to take some to soak the areas properly. Leave the cloth with the vinegar solution for a few minutes. That helps the stains to get removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. When you are done with the soaking, now you need to wash it with cold water. You can use detergent to wash properly. Or, you can just rinse it in the running water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Sun-dry it to make it hygiene. And that is it!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3.

You can choose any of the stain removers that you like. But make sure it ensures a good outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can check the reviews to get a proper description of it.

Firstly, take the cloth and apply the generous amount of stain remover to it. Make sure you apply the remover properly. All the chapstick stained areas must be covered.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. Now, take some time to get rid of the stains. Let the remover sit on the stains accurately. And for that, you need to have some patience. Take time, and soak the cloth properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. After getting the cloth completely soaked, now you need to scrub the areas well. And for doing it, you need a brush. Do not use hard ones for doing the scrubbing.

We know that tape residue contains a sticky texture that is a bit tough to remove it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you take some right steps, and apply it in a right way then you can easily remove it. There are several types of materials. And according to that, the method will be different from each other.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why you need to know what the techniques are and <strong>how to remove tape residue</strong> by executing it properly. Let's jump into the section to clear this out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Basic Method</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ultimate method is to completely wash with dish-washing soap and rubbing alcohol. Let's see the method step by step.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>And to do it, you will need: </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Rubbing alcohol</li><li>A pen knife</li><li>Dish-washing soap</li><li>Warm water&nbsp;</li><li>And a soft cloth&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 1: Scrape the Residue</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, take a pen knife or you can also use butter knife or any kind of blade-like thing instead of it. Then hold the blade on the sticky surface and slide the knife over it. That will help to scrape off the residue quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But make sure you won't do the scraping in a fast way. That might damage the material. And don't scratch the surface too. Scraping is the best option in this case.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2: Soaking</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take a soft cloth and dip it into rubbing alcohol. After that, rub it on the sticky surface, so that the area will be soaked nicely. You can also use nail polish remover or acetone if you have no rubbing alcohol around you.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3: Scrubbing</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a bowl and add about one tablespoon of liquid dish-washing soap and two cups of warm water. Mix it well to get a proper liquid solution. Now, take another soft cloth and dip it into the solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Keep rubbing the place with the cloth. After some time, you can see the stickiness coming out of the surface, and it will feel slippery. At that time, you need to stop the rubbing procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4: Wiping out</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the stickiness comes out, now take another clean cloth and wiping the surface out nicely. Make sure the cloth should properly absorb the remaining liquid on the surface. And that will be enough for cleaning the tape residue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Remove with Oil</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oil is the another effective ingredient for removing tape residue and any kind of stickiness.

Mix it together. Make sure it will be mixed well and leave no lumps.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also use vinegar if you have no oil. Also, you can add warm water if you want. That's how it will create a thick paste that will be effective for removing residue.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3: Applying</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take the paste and apply onto the surface.

You need to take a generous amount of alcohol on a soft cloth and gently apply onto the sticky surface. Leave it for a few minutes to be properly soaked.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3: Scrubbing</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, this is an optional step. You can skip it. But if you feel the residue doesn't come out and it will need an extra push then scrubbing is necessary. And for doing it, take a brush to scrub it in a steady way. Don't push it too hard but just gently scrub it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4: Wiping Out</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The last step will be wiping out.

You just have to have a sharp tip line. That's why you need to know what will be the easy and effective way to get the perfect trip. Let's get right into the details to get the idea and some interesting hacks too.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Method of sharpening eyeliner pencil</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sharpening any kind of pencil is simple. So does eyeliner pencil. But there are some tricks that we are doing to share with you so that you will get much benefit than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, without any further delay, let's get in.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1: Freeze first</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first step will be freezing the pencil. Yes, it needs to be done properly. It's a great trick because it will make the pencil harder than before and you will sharpen it without any breakage.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for doing it, but that pencil in the freezer for 5-7 minutes. But if you have an eyeliner pencil that is thicker in size then you need to freeze it for a longer time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doing it is important because it will help to do the upcoming procedures smoothly. Also, if the pencil is hard then there will be no chance of breaking while sharpening. So, freeze it well before getting into the other part.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Use rubbing alcohol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another trick to get a perfect sharpening is using rubbing alcohol. Yes, you heard it right. It has a great benefit as it has a disinfecting quality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not for the sharpening, but for sanitizing, this will be an effective one. But what would you sanitize? You need to use the rubbing alcohol to sanitize the sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though you are going to sharpen an eyeliner pencil, you need to be very careful about hygiene. And though it's about your eyes and you are going to use this liner for defining your eyes, you need to ensure the hygiene and safety of your sensitive eye.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do it properly, all you need is a cotton bud. Take a cotton bud and dip it into the rubbing alcohol. And then, it's ready to use.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Clean the sharpener</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cotton bud that you have soaked into the disinfecting rubbing alcohol, now you need to use it in this purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before getting into any sharpening process, you need to clean the sharpener first. And that's why you need to apply this technique too.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take the soaked cotton bud and start cleaning the sharpener properly. There could be some pencil residue that must be cleaned. Also, rubbing alcohol helps to disinfect the entire sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, do the cleaning by gently swabbing. If the first bud will get dirty, then you can take the other one. Use buds by soaking properly according to your need. That's how clean both inside and outside areas of the sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Take the eyeliner out of the free freezer</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After 5 minutes of freezing, now take the pencil out from the freezer. You will feel the hardness of it when you are touching the frozen eyeliner.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you feel it's not that much hard and it's almost the same as the non-frozen one, that's mean it's not done yet. At that time, you need to freeze it again. Put it in the freezer and again after 5 minutes, check if it's done or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It actually depends on the hardness of the pencil. Freeze it until you feel the hardness. Remember, the eyeliner pencil should be harder than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Insert the pencil </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After being done with cleaning the sharpener, now it's time to do the sharpening. And to do that, you can use any kind of sharpener like a regular pencil sharpener. It will do the sharpening in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for that, just simply insert the pencil into the hole of the sharpener. Make sure you clean it properly. It is because if the sharpener is cleaned properly then it will be easier to do the next step. Otherwise, the pencil won't be fit into the hole if there is any dirt inside it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take the pencil, and simply insert it. Don't force the pencil because it might break if you do that. Just press the pencil, and it will easily slide into that hole.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Start the sharpening</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it's time to sharpen the pencil with a sharpener. After inserting it, all you need to do is to rotate the pencil. Keep rotating it in a circular motion for at least a couple of times. Or, you can do it until you see the tip of the pencil is sharp enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, you can rotate a full circle, and then check. And if the tip of the pencil isn't sharp yet then do another rotation, and then check again. Repeat this process until you get a perfect sharp tip.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, after a full rotation, take out the shavings. That's how it will be easier to see inside it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 7: Pull out </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>when you are satisfied with the outcome, now you can stop doing the rotating. Make sure the tip is well-sharped.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after completing the sharpening, simply take the pencil out from the sharpener. Don't rush and steadily pull the pencil out of that sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you are fully satisfied with the result. But if you don't, then insert it and repeat the same procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to know that eyeliner pencils should not be excessively sharp. It is because it might hurt your eyes. That's why sharping it by keeping this fact in mind is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 8: Shaping</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After sharpening by using a sharpener, you can give it an extra finish if you want. And you can do it by using a knife or a regular blade.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, you can also use this method if you have no sharpener around you. All you need is a pen knife or an X-acto knife.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for doing it, simply take the knife and hold it on the tip of the pencil. Make sure you hold the knife in your dominant hand and the pencil in your non-dominant hand. You have to hold the pencil downward and sharpen it with the knife in a steady motion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don't rush. Doing it in a fast way might do injury. Keep calm and sharpen it according to your choice.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 9: Repeat if necessary</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have told earlier that if you think you need another rotation to sharpen the pencil again, do it. Don't do several rotations at a time. It might extremely sharpen the tip and thus, break easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead of doing it, sharpen with a single rotation and pull the pencil out to check if it's done or not. Again press the pencil into the hole and sharpen by rotating if it's not done. Repeat this process until you get your desired sharpness.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 10: Testing </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are done with your sharpening, now you have to test it on your hand first. Always remember, don't use the pencil directly on your eyes after sharpening it. The reason is, the sharp tip might hurt your eyes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, it would the best if you test it first so that you will see the pigmentation and can use it according to it. Also, you can see if the sharp tip works appropriately or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for doing the test, draw a line on your back of your hand. See if you are satisfied with it or not. And if you aren't then repeat the process again. Moreover, see the thickness is perfect or not. Overall, see everything and manage the texture according to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 11: Final cleaning</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After finishing all the things of sharpening, now you have to clean the sharpener again. It's necessary because the sharpener should be germ-free. Also, if you keep it clean then it will be easier when you use it next time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for cleaning, take another cotton bud and throw all the shavings away in a garbage bin. Also, clean the blades, and knives too. You can also use rubbing alcohol to clean it in a proper way. After properly clean the sharpener, take and store it in a certain place.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Pro Tips</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Try to purchase that eyeliner that has a sharpener with it.&nbsp;</li><li>Sharpen the pencil at least once in a week to get the defined line every time you use it.&nbsp;</li><li>You can keep an emery board to sharpen anytime you need it.&nbsp;</li><li>Try to do the sharpening over a bin or any kind of trash can so that the shavings will fall directly into it.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hope that you will learn something from this method. This is not an extraordinary method, but we tried to give you some hacks, so that, you can get better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, though eyes are the most sensitive part of our body, you need to be very careful while doing these methods. Maintain hygiene and then sharpen.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall, it's not tough to sharpen eyeliner pencils but make sure you follow the tricks.

You should keep the water pressure at a medium as highly pressurized water could damage the device.</li><li>Take the hose to the other side of the air filter and repeat step 4 again. Keep rinsing the filter until you see the water looks clear to you.

   "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are you confused about the time limit of deep cleaning a\nhouse? Well, it's natural to be so. But you can get rid of it as it can be\nfigured out easily. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you are thinking how much time it will take to deep clean a house, then you have to be concerned about some of the things about it. Basically, deep cleaning takes much time than maintenance cleaning. And once you are done with deep cleaning, maintenance cleaning won't take that much time. But the deep cleaning process after a certain time will take a bit longer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Deep <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/how-to-keep-house-clean-when-dog-is-in-heat/\" >cleaning a house</a> mainly depends on some of the things which are related to the house. Details of the rooms, kitchen, bathrooms and other additional things are important. The more the amount of stuff in a house, the more time you will need to deep clean that house. Besides, the number of people also creates and changes the time period of deep cleaning. The presence of people or the size of rooms in the house creates differences. Let's dive into the deeper explanation so that you will be clearer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":138,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-long-does-it-take-to-deep-clean-a-house.jpg\" alt=\"How long does it take to deep clean a house\" class=\"wp-image-138\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How long does it take to deep clean a house?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it's about cleaning up your house, it's very important to know how to do that. And for that, you need to be cleared about it. And once you are done with all the knowledge, then it will be easier to calculate the exact possible time to finish the deep cleaning of your house. And when it's about deep cleaning, it is become more important to be cleared about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people might have questions about the time period of deep cleaning. It actually depends on how you are going to do that and what are the conditions of the house. There are other things which are the reason for the changing of the time period of deep cleaning. For getting more information, check the details below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Condition of the house</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Different houses have different interior and conditions. The\ntime period for finishing the cleaning process depends on the condition of the\nhouse. There are lots of rooms, a kitchen, washrooms, bathrooms and also other\nplaces in a house. And the conditions of those areas identify how much time it\nwill take to finish the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the conditions of certain places become very bad and the\nother places are not too dirty then it won't take too much time. On the other\nside, if the whole house got very messy for some reason, then it will take more\ntime than before.&nbsp; Basically, it has no\ncertain time limit for ending up the deep cleaning process. It depends on the\nconditions of the whole house. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So at first, before starting the cleaning up thing, you have\nto be cleared about what kind of condition your house has. After knowing fully\nabout it, you can now calculate the exact time of ending up the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Amount of people in the house</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is another thing to be concerned about. The total time\nwhich you will need to finish the process depends on the people also. If you\nhave more people in your house, you have to do more cleanups as the house will\nbe messier. Having lots of people in a house makes that house messier and\ndisorganized.&nbsp; </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Imagine you invited people to a party at your house last\nnight. The party is over but you have to do cleanups now. When there are lots\nof guests at a party, it's natural that the house will be a mess. And for that\nreason, it will take lots of time to deep clean that house. You need to give\nmore time when it's about deep cleaning. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's how you cannot guess the actual time period of\ncleaning a house. It totally depends on the events and the number of people in\nthat house. And if the number of people is small and there won't be lots of\npeople around the house, then it won't take that much time to that deep\ncleaning process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Having animals or not</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, the thing is important whether you are having animals\nand sorts of pets or not. It is because the thing is quite depending on how\nlong the process will take. And if there is any pet or any kind of animal in\nyour house then it will take more time to finish all the cleaning things. And\nwhen it's about deep cleaning, it will definitely take more time than the house\nwithout any pet. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The houses which have animals are becoming very messy. It is\nbecause the pets are always messy in nature. And if the pet is living with you\nin your house, the house will be disorganized and very dirty for sure. So,\ncleaning all those messes will take much time than the other one. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Amount of rooms</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The amount of rooms and other stuff is as important as the\nnumber of people in a house. The more the number of rooms is increased, the\nmore time you will need to deep clean the house. And if you have a lot of\nrooms, a kitchen, storeroom, bathrooms, living room and other stuff in the\nhouse, then you will need more time to complete the process. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you have fewer rooms, a small living room, fewer\nbathrooms and other stuff, then you will need less time to clean. All of those\ncleaning things depend on the number as well as the space of that house. Both\nthings are equally important for the time period of deep cleaning a house. It\nis because if you have a large area in your house then you will take more time\nto clean it up. And if you have a house that is small, you will need less time.\nSo, all of those things depend on the structure of the whole house. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Kids or no kids</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They say kids are ANGEL! But when you are going to clean a\nhouse where a kid is present in, you will realize kids are a mess and obviously\nit's natural. It is because they are innocent and they don't know how to keep\nthe places clean. And thus they create the place a messy one. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, if you're wondering about how much time it will take to\ndeep clean a house, you need to look at the number of people in your house and\nthe presence of a child. If you have a grown-up kid or a baby, you will have to\nmaintain a lot of things. And if a kid is present in any house, it will\ndefinitely create a mess. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's the reason, having a baby will increase the amount of\nyour work and thus it will take more time if you are going to do a deep clean\nin your house. So, being clear about it is important to figure out the time\nperiod of any work. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using cleaning tools or not</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are going to do the deep cleaning process with smart\ncleaning tools, it will help you more. Thus it will take less time to finish\nall the cleaning. And if you are not using those modern cleaning tools and just\nusing your regular tools then you will take more time to finish for sure. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Such as, if you use a vacuum cleaner for cleaning dirt,\nwashing machines for clothes and other advanced cleaning ingredients for better\nresults will help you to finish all the cleaning work fast. And when it's about\ndeep cleaning, then these things will help you more. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you are not using those cleaning items but just use\nthe simple things to make the house cleaner, then you need to save more time\nfor deep cleaning as it will take more time without the advanced tools. So, the\ntime of this cleaning process is also depending on the product which you are\ngoing to use while deep cleaning the house. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Tips for deep cleaning a house faster</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. For removing stains, you can use baking soda, lemon and\nother kinds of special ingredients that help to remove those stubborn stains. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2.

These methods will be useful for you as it will reduce the pressure of yours to clean it properly. So, let's check what the incredible methods are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Baking soda</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, we talk about baking soda. We all know how amazingly the baking soda works for removing any kind of stain. It is also great for removing burnt grease from the surface of the pan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for applying it, you just need to take the burnt pan and sprinkle soda on the burnt area. Let it sit for a few minutes. You should add some water on it so that it can soak properly. After a while, scrub it off and you will see how incredibly the stains come out from the surface.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it can be a bit pricey but it works like magic. It removes stains from both the stainless steel and the other types of pans too. To get a better result, soak it for a long time before scrubbing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Vinegar</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we know that, vinegar is an acidic product that is used for cooking, and even for some household activities. There are 5-20% acetic acid that the vinegar contains. And this amount of acid helps to remove stains easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, vinegar is available in almost every house. That's why you can choose this element if you don't have a cleaner around you or you want a better result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, it's useful for stains. For getting better results, you need to pour some vinegar on the burnt place, and leave it for 15-20 minutes. After that, take a scrubber and scrub it nicely until the stains come out. It's easy and simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Soak and scrub</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter what element you use, if you don't soak it then you won't be able to get rid of the stains. That's why you have to soak the ingredients on the pan, and then do the next process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soaking is an ancient procedure that is used by almost all people. It's effective for removing tough stains in an easy way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, scrubbing is not enough. It just does half of the work. You also need to scrub the stained places after completing the soaking process. That's how you can get the effective results.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4. Bar keepers friend</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bar Keepers Friend is a stain cleaning element that has been used since 1882. It's effective for reducing and removing stubborn stains. It's a powerful cleanser, and it's specialized for cleaning this kind of stuff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's actually good stuff, and it works very impressively. And to get the impressive outcome, you need to use it properly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using it is an easy process. You need to apply this powder-textured element just like the baking soda. Simply sprinkle the powder on the stained area and add some water to soak it nicely. After 5-10 minutes, scrub the places and wash as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can see it takes all the grease away, and it works very quickly. Overall, it's a thumbs up for this element.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>5. Ketchup</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's basically an experimental process you can say. Ketchup has an acid that can remove the stains of the pan. You just need to apply the ketchup on the places that are burnt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if we compare it with the previous elements, then we won't recommend you this as it will take much time. And if you want to clean the entire frying pan with this then it will be tough to clean because the cleaning process of it is slow. But if you don't have any alternative around you then you can use this as an experiment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>6. Heat and scrub</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Heating is another effective way to clean the frying pan surface. All you need to do is, take the burnt pan and pour any of the elements like baking soda, vinegar, salt, or things like that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, start the flame. You can mix a little amount of water with it. Heat the pan in a high flame for a few minutes. Once you are done, then turn off the flame and scrub it as before. Make sure the heat won't hurt your hand. Because of scrubbing, you will see the burnt grease coming off the surface. And when you will scrub all over the surface nicely then wash it with plain water and leave it for air dry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>7. Baking powder, sea salt, vinegar</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can mix baking soda, vinegar, and sea salt all together. It can provide you better results. And for doing it, take a bowl and mix all the ingredients to make a paste. Then apply the paste on the stain and soak it for some time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, scrub it well, and wash the surface with water. You have to make sure that you soak the pan with that paste properly. That's how you can get the better results easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>8. Cream of Tartar</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cream of Tartar is another element that is used for cleaning. It can <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/how-to-clean-burnt-grease-from-bottom-of-frying-pans/\" >clean the burnt pans</a> too. It seems good how cream of tartar removes burnt grease.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ingredient is called cream of tartar, but it's not in a cream-based formula. It's a powder-based element that you can use for reducing stain. And for doing it, use this powder and cover the pan with it. Add some water and then scrub it perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you use it, you can see some changes but it cannot remove all the stains. It works slowly and thus provides average results. You might get a benefit like the bar keepers friend but it has to be soaked for a longer time to get that result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can see through the methods that almost all the methods have the same procedures of cleaning. However, we will recommend you to use baking soda and bar keepers friends. These two are amazing. But baking soda can be a bit expensive for you. At that time, use a bar keepers friend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But in an overall sense, you can apply any of those methods. And we assure you that you won't be disappointed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

But doing that isn't an appropriate thing. And they also flush down hair the most.

It will clog both the areas to the hairbrush and the drain of the bathroom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like the same way, it will also clog the area of the commode if you flush hair down the toilet. The reason is, hair breaks down slowly. That's why you can absolutely say that doing this isn't a proper thing that you often do. You absolutely cannot do that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, hair is the most common element to clog the pipe. That's why doing it is not safe. Further, when the long hair goes into the toilet, it creates a web that can easily stop any type of flow. That's how the toilet gets clogged easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's so easy to make a ball of hair and throw it into the toilet. But if you realize what the outcomes will be then you will not do that at all. The hair and the other materials can stick together easily and help to make a clogged pipe. That's why we will keep saying repeatedly that flushing the hair down the toilet is not a good option to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Will hair block the toilet?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you knew earlier that the one thing that can go through the toilet is human waste. Many of the people flush toilet papers into it but it's also an inappropriate thing to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, hair is a thing that can easily clog the toilet. It can clog pipe downstream of the toilet too. Further, there is another thing that can be problematic when you are flushing hair down the toilet. And that is the hair down the drain that can make all kinds of havoc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hair is a biodegradable property, and that's why it can leave down there for a longer time than other elements. It also can clog the outer filter and that's why you need to dig up and clean out the filter nicely. So, it's clear that the hair can clog the toilet and block that line.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What should you do then?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's proved that flushing hair down the toilet is an inappropriate idea. That's why you have to be careful especially when you are in the bathroom. It is because flushing it down will completely clog the flowing area. It will make the water flowing stop, and it might bring a lot of trouble to you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what should you do then? You can do two things to avoid this stress. Firstly, you can throw the hairs away. That's the simple thing to do. The other thing is, you can compost it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, you can try to compost the hair. Yes, you should know that hair is compost-able. You can compost it to get rid of the clogging. Many of you might not know that it's a good source of nitrogen. And that nitrogen is good for soil. That's why you can use hair for composting instead of wasting it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for doing that, you should simply mix the hair in the compost pile. You can also add the other elements with it and compost it. Make sure you do the process by adding a small amount of elements because that will be easier to compost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you don't find the composting procedure useful, then you can simply throw all the hairs away. The best place to throw it is in the trash bin. That might not be environment-friendly but it will surely help to get rid of the clogging of the toilet. That's why you can surely apply any of the two options and thus you can stay away from the trouble.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What can you flush down the toilet?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are not all the things that you can flush down the toilet. There are some things that you can flush. It's important to know what the things are that can be disposed of through flush.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the right thing is going down the toilet, it won't harm anything because it will flush away and nothing can be clogged up. And all the watery things that are being flushed, eventually go to the rivers and sea. So, it will be a beneficial thing that we got from nature.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if the things are not flushed and put it in the bin then it can harm the normality of nature. But first, you need to know what the things are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Any kind of liquid and wastewater can be flushed down the toilet. It won't create any difficulties to the commode, and thus these kinds of things can be flushed down easily. So be careful before flush anything down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Things you should never flush down the toilet</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not all kinds of things that you can flush down the toilet. There are certain things that can be flushed away. It is because flushing down all the things can be inappropriate for the toilet. The commode can get clogged up for flushing down inappropriate things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have learned earlier about what things we can flush down the toilet. Generally, any kind of wastewater can be flushed, and it's obvious to have that facility because the toilet is made for that purpose.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But there are some elements that people generally flush. But doing that isn't the right thing. Those elements can clog the commode area and the other areas too. And there are several things such as, any kind of wet wipes like makeup wipes, baby wipes, toilet wipes, and many more. Most of the people think that flush those wipes down is fine. But it's not a right thing even if there is written \"flushable\" on the cover.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, any kind of cotton pad or cotton wool is also an inappropriate property to flush down. There are also some elements like cleansing pads, dental floss, cigarette butts, toilet roll tubes, sanitary napkins, medicines, nappies, tampons, plasters, and these kinds of things cannot be flushed down the toilet at all as it can cause damages to the water flow of the toilet, and that made it harmful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Wrap up</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We often don't realize what we are flushing down the toilet. Of course, it's an obvious thing to be an absent-minded human in that case. But it should be noticed what you are flushing down through the water. It is because there can be some inappropriate things that shouldn't be flushed down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's the reason you should always be aware of that thing to avoid the upcoming trouble.

Add a water-based shampoo and mix it well. Adding shampoo is important because it can help you to get rid of the dirt and futile from the comb easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also use shower gel and mix it with lukewarm water.

After doing that, rinse those brushes off with cold water and wipe it out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing that you should be careful of is to avoid using any harmful dish-washing liquid, or any detergent. The reason is the material. As you know, the brushes are made of plastic or wood. Using harmful washing elements can ruin the material of the brush.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Mix all the ingredients</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After doing that, now find out what ingredients you will need to start cleaning the hairbrushes.

Mix it well. Don't take too much hot water that is not touchable. You can also add some apple cider vinegar into it. Then mix all the ingredients nicely to get into the next steps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Damp the hairbrush</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are done with mixing the ingredients, now it's time to clean the brushes. And for doing it, you need to damp the brushes well. Let it there for some time so that all the baking soda mixture can go to the brushes and you don't face any problem while washing it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have to soak the brushes for about 20-30 minutes. After soaking it, start cleaning using an old thin toothbrush. You will see the dirt can easily come out from the inner corners of the brushes. That's the result of the soaking procedure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Wiping out</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After finishing the deep cleaning, the next step is to wipe the brushes out in a nice way. Take the wet brushes, and wipe it out using a towel or tissue paper. It can help the brushes to remove the excess water. You should do the wiping procedure in a dabbing movement and that will help the brushes to get rid of the excess water easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use another technique for drying it out. Use an electric hair dryer, and that will help you to dry it out in an easy way. But make sure the heat of the dryer won't be that much high that the material of the brushes can't take it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if the brushes are waterproof or made of plastic then, you don't have to do anything. Just wait, and it will dry out automatically. And if the brushes are made of wood then, you need to follow the drying procedures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 7: Repeat</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After doing all the procedures, then you need to recheck if there is any dirt remaining on the brushes or not. And if you find any of it then you will need repeating the processes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do the cleaning processes the same way until you will find the brushes properly cleaned. Also, you need to clean your brushes when it's needed. You need to do the cleaning procedures twice in a week to maintain the cleanliness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's how you can always have a nice, clean, and shiny hairbrush that will also help to maintain the blood circulation of your hair and protect it from damages.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Wrap Up</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see, we described several rules of cleaning the hairbrushes with baking soda. But many people think that using baking soda is harmful. But let me enlighten you. it's the most effective way to clean any kind of dirt or stain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you still don't agree with it and don't want to use this method then you can also follow some simple tricks to keep your combs cleaned.

Well, you might face a dilemma whether you should use it or avoid it. And for getting into a conclusion, you need to know about the effectiveness of borax.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Borax is a kind of thing that is basically sodium tetraborate. It's used for reducing the creeping charlie. But the best part is, it won't harm the grass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As creeping charlie is an invasive perennial leaf, borax can form a toxic spot to the area that you spread the entire borax mixture. And that's how it can kill the creeping charlie. So, yes, it's true that using borax is an excellent idea to reduce and totally kill the creeping charlie weed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for that, you need to apply borax mixture when the leaves are just starting to grow. But make sure you won't use it excessively. It is because if you use it frequently then it can damage the grass too. The proper amount of using it should be once or twice in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Get Rid of Creeping Charlie with Borax</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":290,\"width\":280,\"height\":415,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-to-Get-Rid-of-Creeping-Charlie-with-Borax-1.png\" alt=\"How to Get Rid of Creeping Charlie with Borax\" class=\"wp-image-290\" width=\"280\" height=\"415\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Removing creeping charlie is not a difficult task to do. It's even easier than removing the other kinds of plants. All you need to do is to take the right steps. Though borax has an absolute weed reducing formula, it also has some side effects. But using it appropriately can harm the grass less.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make a perfect solution in an easy way, let's take a look at the ingredients, and the methods that we are going to describe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>For making the solution, you will need</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>10 oz.

It will mix all ingredients together in an easy way.&nbsp; But it will be better if you use an old blender and avoid the regular one. The reason is, the borax can mix with the food when you will use the blender later for food preparation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Pour it</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are done with all the mixing and making, then you need to take a nice spray bottle. You can have a regular one if you have one in your house or you can get it from a store. Then pour all the mixture in a spray bottle and start the spraying process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Spreading</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you have to take the bottle and spray it all over the garden area.

The reason is that it will make the entire process easier. You cannot clean the brushes properly if the hair is stuck into the bristles of the brushes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, old hair that is stuck into the brushes can spread infections. Though in a salon, a brush is used for different purposes and interacts with different hair of different people, that's why cleaning every hair from all the brushes is important.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to clean the brushes and the combs, take the brushes and untie all the hair. You can use a brush cleaner that can be found online. Or else, you can take another comb to remove the hair easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you find the hair being much stubborn and it's being hard to take them off, then you can use scissors. Cut the hair off with the scissors and take all the hair away and throw it in the bin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: scrubbing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next step is scrubbing. After getting rid of all the hair from the brushes, now it's time to scrub them well. You can use any kind of ready-made scrubber to clean them nicely. The reason for scrubbing is, it will dust off almost all dirt that is present in the corners of the bristles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, cleaning it in that way will make the entire process easy for you. To clean the hair brushes professionally, this step is necessary for deep cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want a deeper cleaning finish, you can use a toothbrush.

It might damage or break the bristles of it. Be gentle and allow the scrubber to clean the area properly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Pre-wash</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time to pre-wash it. Pre-washing means you need to get all the brushes together and make these ready for cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for cleaning it, you need to take a bucket or a large box so that the bushes can be soaked well. Put all the brushes into the box and add water.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you pour a lot of water that it can totally cover the brushes. The box should be full with water. After that, add any kind of liquid cleanser into it. You can also use dish washing liquid soap. The results will be the same. And then, let the brushes into the mixture for about 7-10 minutes. That will be enough for getting done with the pre-wash.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other thing that you should be careful of is the timing. You need to be particular about it. 10 minutes for soaking is enough. And if you will keep it longer, then it might bring different results. And if you soak it for a shorter time then it will be tough to clean easily and quickly. So, you need to follow all the steps in the same way we are describing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: soaking for disinfecting and clean</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The previous step informs you about the preparation of cleaning.

After soaking into a dish soap solution, now, take all the brushes out from the submerged water and put those into another box.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you rinse it a little bit with plain water and then put those brushes and combs into another box.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, we are going to start the disinfection process.

Drying is as important as cleaning. It has because if you don't dry it out then you won't be able to finish the entire process perfectly. And that's why you might won't get the perfect result. So, maintain the process as described.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for doing it, you will need two towels. Yes, the drying process should be done by using a towel. So, take all the brushes out from the liquid solution. Now, take a towel and put all the brushes on it. Make sure you do all the processes with your gloves on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take another towel and cover the brushes well. Let the brushes for at least a couple of hours. It would be best if you let them be there for drying overnight. In the next morning, uncover the towel and you will see the perfectly cleaned brushes that will look like new. Now, it's ready for use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Is disinfecting the brushes important?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, disinfecting the brushes is important. If you don't want to clean your brushes and sanitize it, then it might spread bacterias and viruses that won't totally be a healthy thing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, it's important to clean your entire hair brush collection regularly.

We will let you know different ways of cleaning the coffee maker. Keep reading the below pieces of write up to know the procedures in brief.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":450,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-to-Clean-Braun-Coffee-Maker.png\" alt=\"How to Clean Braun Coffee Maker\" class=\"wp-image-450\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Clean Braun Coffee Maker</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can clean the Braun Coffee Maker using a variety of ways. However, we will let you know about the most effective procedures below. Check out the first procedure from below:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Washing the Pot</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Coffee pot is the part of the coffee maker that needs to be cleaned regularly after brewing the copy. Cleaning the coffee pot is pretty easy, especially when cleaned immediately after brewing the coffee. You can use dishwashing soap and warm water to clean the pot. Cleaning the container will ensure that the glass is clean and look new for a long time. More so, it will also resist any accumulation and burn in the glass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can give a deep clean to the pot once in a month. It is imperative, especially when you need to use hard water for preparing coffee. Hard water can build a deposit inside the coffee pot, which can make the container look ugly. Such deposits typically do not come off with the usual soap and water solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vinegar can help you to remove the hard water deposits from the coffee pot. Simply add tablespoons of vinegar in the pot and then pour water to the maximum level. Now close the container and shake it around 20 seconds. Then remove the solution from the pot and rinse it with fresh water. If there are any excess residue or vinegar left on the pot, you may clean them off with warm water and soap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Cleaning the Detachable Parts</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost all models of the Braun Coffee Maker feature different removable parts, such as the brew basket. The brew baskets can hold the coffees that outflow from the filter while brewing. These coffees can easily mix with the fresh brews and make the taste bitter. So, it is also essential to clean the removable parts, including the brew baskets. You can easily wash the brew basket using the hot water and soap solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, you can also clean the brew basket inside a dishwasher for easier and efficient results. The parts also require a thorough clean within a while. Fill the device with a vinegar solution and pull the valve to clean the below parts where coffee drips from. This procedure will take a little time, but it can ensure an efficient result by washing the entire piece.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Washing the Interior</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of the other parts of the machine that you need to clean include the water reservoir and the inner tubing. However, you may not entirely wash the parts efficiently using the soap and water solution. Instead, use a 1 part vinegar and 2 part water solution to clean these components once in a month.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Running such a clean will bring out any cooked coffee particles, mineral deposits, hard water deposits, etc. from the parts. Make sure to brew some pots of regular water to remove the vinegar solutions left inside the machine entirely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Descaling Process Recommended by Manufacturer</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Descaling the coffee machines means removing the mineral buildup inside the machine. When you use the usual tap water while brewing the coffee, different minerals like calcium, magnesium, etc. from water pass through the device. These mineral materials can cause limescale in the machine's heating component. Such deposits can make the coffee taste bad, and also decrease the lifespan of the device.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Descaling the Braun Coffee Maker is pretty easier when compared with the coffee makers from the other manufacturer. There is a built-in mode that lets you automatically descale the device. It also indicates you about the times to descale with an LED that lights up solid green. Here are the actions that you require to follow to run the descaling procedure:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Start with detaching the charcoal water filter holder along with the charcoal water filter. You will also need to remove the gold-tone permanent filter.</li><li>The put the carafe in the right position on the keep warm plate. Now click on the Clean button to start the procedure.</li><li>If the green LED starts flashing, then it means that the process has started. You can start the descaling program while the LED is flashing by pressing on BREW. Make sure to be fully ready before beginning the process as you cannot stop it once started.</li><li>The Green LED will stop when the descaling program is completed. You can remove the carafe and clean it thoroughly with fresh water to get rid of the residue.</li><li>Now fill the water reservoir of the coffee maker with 12 cups or a full carafe of freshwater. Then run two complete brew cycles to flush off the stubborn deposits. Make sure to use cold water during each cycle.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Generally, it will take around 45 minutes to finish the cleaning cycle along with rinsing. You may run the cycle several times to find the best result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Maintenance Tips to Keep Your Braun Coffee Maker at Its Best</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want to enjoy the fantastic taste of freshly brewed copy from the Braun Coffee Maker, then implement tips from now on:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Clean and descale the coffee maker device regularly to ensure the better taste of coffee and efficient performance of the machine.</li><li>Offer a thorough clean with vinegar solution once in a month to resist the buildup and deposits in the coffee maker.</li><li>Follow the given instructions in the user manual to brew the coffee as well as for descaling.</li><li>Turn off the machine when it is not in use. Doing so will not only reduce energy usage but also prolong the lifespan of the device.</li><li>Clean the carafe as soon as possible after preparing the coffee. Leaving the part uncleaned with coffee will make it unclean as well as develop ugly stains.</li><li>Replace the required parts once in six months to ensure the proper taste of the coffee.</li><li>Don't use the detergent or cleaning solution that is marked safe for the device. You may use the specialized coffee maker machine detergent for safe and efficient cleaning.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you see above, cleaning the Braun coffee Maker machine is not that hard. More so, it doesn't require frequent cleanup. If you want to keep enjoying the taste of freshly brewed coffee from the device, you should clean and maintain it periodically in the correct way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

Different kinds of shoes require a distinct method of cleaning. Below, we will let you know about the step by step process of cleaning the Sperrys suede:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step-1</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Start with brushing the shoes using a soft gain suede brush. Gently brush the shoes to get rid of the dust and dirt from the surface. To end up with a better result, brush the shoes repeatedly in a specific direction with short strokes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step-2</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are suede bars that you can use to eradicate the stubborn scuffs from hard-to-reach areas. You can also utilize a pencil eraser or crepe rubber if you don't have access to the suede bar. Apply moderate pressure on the affected areas and tighter the pressure if needed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step-3</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If there are any water stains on the shoes, then this step will be helpful for you. Use a slightly soaked sponge and dab it on the affected area. Then use a dry microfiber cloth to get rid of the excess moisture. If the stain is not still removed, damp the sponge in white vinegar and then rub it through the area.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step-4</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>None of the methods mentioned above will work if you are dealing with oil stain. There is an easy way to remove such stains from the Sperrys Suedes. Just sprinkle some cornstarch on the stained area and then leave it for ten minutes. The oil stain should be lifted-off.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Cleaning the Usual Leather Sperrys</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the above, you have acknowledged how to clean Sperry's suede. Now check out how you can clean the usual Sperrys leather shoes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step-1:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Start with removing the bigger dust, dirt, debris using a soft bristle toothbrush. It will be better to use a quality soft bristle brush that is made of cleaning the leather. Also, try to go for a rubber bristled brush instead of the nylon one for comfortable and safe cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step-2:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you will need to prefer a cleaning solution with water and mild dish soap for farther cleaning. Dip a microfiber cloth in the solution and then sweep the shoes with it. Apply gentle pressure in a circular motion to get rid of the scuffs and residual dirt. Try to complete the step quickly. That is because making the leather surface excessive wet can cause the fibers less supple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Never use other cleaning solutions like saddle soap on the shoes as it can break down and damage the leather of the shoe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step-3:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have performed the above measures, then it is time to dry the shoe. Use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe out and dry the shoe surface quickly. Follow the same circular motion with gentle rub like before to ensure no harm. You can only continue to the next action after drying the shoes thoroughly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this step, we will use a leather conditioner on the shoes. You may want to proceed without this step, but conditioning the shoes will ensure that the footwear will not dry out and crack. Using a proper leather conditioner on the shoes will ensure a long lifespan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apply the conditioner using a soft cloth on the shoe leather. Let the shoe absorb the moisture for around 10 to 20 minutes. Then utilize a dry cloth to eliminate the excess moisture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 5:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this step, we will polish the shoes to make them shiny. Use a soft and clean cloth to use the polish on the shoes using a clockwise motion. Then use a clean cloth to remove the excess polish in a counterclockwise motion. Polishes are available two variations, which are wax and cream.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cream polish is a better choice for retaining the shoe's color at its best. On the other hand, wax polishes are suitable for making the footwear shiny. Make sure to test the polish at first by applying in a small amount. Don't use it if you see any discoloration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 6:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now use a soft microfiber cloth again to buff the shoes. Use the cloth in a circular motion with direct pressure. You may add some drops of water on the fabric for extra shine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can rely on this procedure to clean the suede shoes made of underside leather of animals without causing any damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Tips to Maintain your Sperrys Suede</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Sperrys Suede are pretty costly, and you may not want to through them away anytime soon.

Eyewear glasses are something that just cannot clean with any fabric. Using different clothes for cleaning glasses instead of the microfiber cloth can damage the glass surface. More so, it can push the dirt and dust more in-depth into the surface, which will eventually blur. On the other hand, using the wrong cloth for cleaning the glass will also scratch and scuff the lenses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The microfiber cloths are specially designed for cleaning the glass surface without causing any damage to the lens. It consists of millions of fibers in a smaller area, making it useful for reaching the tricky glass surface to pick up any dust or grime with one sweep. More so, the clothes are positively charged, which makes it attract negatively charged dirt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That means physics also supports the effectivity of the microfiber cloth for cleaning the glasses. So, never attempt to use any other types of fabric for cleaning the lenses without microfibers. Sweeping the glass lenses with other clothes will make the dust go deeper. If you don’t have lost the clothes that came with your glass, you may use a microfiber towel for cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Wash Microfiber Cloth for Glasses</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Microfiber cloths are not like the usual clothes, as we mentioned so many times earlier. There are different ways of cleaning the glass cleaning cloths. Below, we will explain some of the best ways of washing microfiber clothes as well as some best practices:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Rinse the Cloth after Every Use</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most important to maintain the microfiber cloth properties is to clean by rinsing every day. The cloth can collect all the dirt and debris from the glass surface every time you use it. And, this stuff is not going anywhere but staying on the cloth. Using the cloth without cleaning for several times will make it dirty. And the dirt can scratch the lens if used with the dirt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dirt and grimes also make it harder for you to clean the cloth. So, it is good to clean the microfiber cloth by rinsing in the freshwater after every time you use it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Use Warm/Lukewarm Water While Washing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using warm water to clean the <a href=\"https://www.explainthatstuff.com/microfibercloths.html\" class=\"rank-math-link\">microfiber cloth</a> will give you a better result than using the cold water. The heat of the water will help remove the dirt and grime quickly by loosening the fiber's grips. Ensure that you are not using hot water, as it will cause impairment in the microfibers, making them useless. Some brands also recommend using nothing but cold water for cleaning clothes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Don’t Clean them with Other Clothes</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You shouldn't clean the microfiber cloths with the other varieties of fabric in your house. As the microfiber clothes pick and gather the dirt, they can also affect the other laundry items. The little microfibers in the cloth will get clogged and cause lint, making the cleaning project worthless. The same thing goes for the laundry bags. So, it is better to clean the microfiber clothes separately. However, you may clean the glass cleaning cloth with the other microfiber cloths and microfiber towels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Use a Mild Dish Washing Liquid If Required</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You may want to give a thorough clean to the microfiber cloth. If so, then use a mild dishwashing liquid for the cleaning process. Never think of using the powder detergent as it may leave residue in the cloth even after cleaning. More so, if you are using the dishwashing liquid, then use a chlorine bleach-free solution. That is because bleach can cause damage in filament to the microfibers. It can also reduce the positive charge of the cloth, making it less useful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Washing Microfiber Cloth in Washing Machine</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, you can clean the microfiber cloth using a washing machine without any issues. However, make sure to use the appropriate gentle liquid detergent in the device. The cleaning solution should be bleach-free and don’t include any fabric softener. The fabric softener can also reduce the ability of the microfiber cloth to pick dirt. Clean the fabric separately and don't use hot water while cleaning in the washing machine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Drying the Cloth</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It doesn't matter which procedure you use to clean the microfiber cloth, make sure to dry it properly after the cleanse. Drying the microfiber cloth adequately will ensure long-term usability. It will not wash a lot of time to dry the fabric as the microfiber cloths dry pretty quickly. Don't attempt to use a dryer for quicker drying as you may end up damaging the fabrics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How Long Can Microfiber Cloth Last?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the benefits of microfiber cloths is that they are usually more durable than the other varieties of clothes. As per some sources, the clothes can survive up to 500 washes without any issues. That means you can use the cloth for around two years on moderate uses. However, the information may not go with all the varieties of microfiber cloths in the market. Besides, some manufacturers can also deduct the quality for a cheaper price.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Glass lenses are pretty sensitive, and they can easily get damaged if not handled carefully. The microfiber cloths can help you extend the glass's lifespan by keeping it clean. It is crucial to keep the fabric free from dirt and grimes to use it for a long time. Hopefully, you will comprehend how to clean the microfiber cloths correctly after reading the article.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

It is because the stove will get hot while cooking. And you cannot do any cleaning process on that hot stove.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, it can be harmful if you try to do it with that stove. It can burn you anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, try to leave it for some minutes or an hour until the stove cools down completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Peeling&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And when the burner is cooled down properly, now it's time to peel the plastic off from the stove. At that stage, you might not be able to peel off all the plastic.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, try to do this as much as you can. That will help to do the next steps easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Scrapping Away&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take a knife for scrapping. A butter knife will be better for doing this. It can scrape the plastic away in a mild way. And that's why it won't damage the texture of the glass stove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, you can also use a spoon if you have no butter knife around you. It works the same way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You just need to scrape it gently. And make sure you won't make any scratch on the glass of the stove.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Soaking&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take WD-40 and spray it all over the area. Now, let it be there for some minutes. That will help to soak properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But, if you don't have that, then you can also use olive oil instead of it. That will also be beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soak it in the same way. And leave the stove there.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Scrape Again&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's time to rescrape it. At that time, take a razor blade and with the help of it, you can scrape easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have to make sure of your holding angle. You need to hold the razor in a straight way. So, take the blade and hold it as straight as possible. This will help to avoid scratching on the surface of the stove.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, maintain that and steadily scrape the plastic out of the stove. You will see, this helps to get the burnt plastic out without harming the texture of the glass.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Baking Soda Solution&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After being done with the scrapping, you can now use a solution for getting a better result. And to do that, take baking soda and sprinkle all over the surface that you want to clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you know, baking soda works magically, especially on the tough stains. And when it's about cleaning the burnt plastic on a glass stove and try to make it like a new one, you can use it for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, spread baking soda all over the area and let it be soaked for a generous amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 7: Scrub Off&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, you need to scrub those soaked areas after getting done with soaking. And for doing this, you will need a soft cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And with it, scrub those areas in a gentle way. The main purpose of it should be the cleaning of the plastic. So, make sure it won't do any kind of scratch on the surface.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And by considering these things, scrub the places, and clean all over.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 8: Repeat&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can consider these <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/deep-cleaning-house-checklist/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">steps as the proper cleaning process</a>. You can repeat these steps if you see any stain or plastic that isn't scrubbed off yet. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, at that time, repeat as many times as you want. All you need to be satisfied with the results. That's why do the procedures again until all the plastics are removed well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 9: Nail Polish Remover for finishing&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can stop at the previous step. But you can do one more additional thing. And that is to use nail polish remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It will help to make the stove cleaner than before. All you need to do is soaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this stage of cleaning, the maximum part of the burnt plastic is removed. So, you don't need to give a lot of effort now.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just take the remover and apply it to soak. Take a cotton ball or a soft cloth or whatever soft textured thing you like, and then soak it with the liquid remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, apply at the places where you want a specific cleanup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, if you use the acetone nail polish remover before, you must knew that it can evaporate quickly. That's why you must keep using it often to keep the moisture. So, keep reapplying it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 10: Scrub Again&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After soaking, you have to scrub it again. You can use a regular scrubber for that. And then, start scrubbing it all over the area in a gentle way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That will help to get the leftover plastic out from the stove in an easy way. And no scratches will be created because of this technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 11: Cleaning&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point, you will find most of the places without any kind of plastic on it. So, it will easier to do this. Now, it's time to do ultimate cleaning. And for that, use a mild soap to clean it perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And you will need warm water with it. Mix these things together, and clean all the areas of that stove. Make sure there is no oil, or any other residue exist.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And in that way, you can get a properly cleaned surface. And after that, you can take another soft cloth, and clean it again by soaking it with water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 12: Drying&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you can wipe it out to make it completely dry. Also, you can air dry it. Just leave it for some hours and it will be dry naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's all it is.

Take a spoon and mix both of the ingredients in a nice way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apply the mixture onto the surface well. Make sure you cover all the stains with this paste completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use a dab motion while applying the paste. In that way, the paste will go into the wall and soak the stains easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, let the solution be on the wall for a few minutes. It will help to soak properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soaking is important because when the wall will be soaked completely, chances of getting rid most of the stains will be increased.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why take some time for applying and soaking the entire mixture well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take a paper towel or a clean cloth and remove the excess solution by using a dabbing motion once again.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing you need to be aware of and that is, you should not soak for a long time. 10-15 minutes will be enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also spray water at this point, if you think wiping is not enough. But after spraying water, again wipe out the excess and have a clean wall.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 6:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that you are done with all your cleaning the spot and removing the stains, you should now keep the wall dried.

The solution is simple. Take oxalic acid, and mix it with water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And then it's time to apply it.

So, without wasting any time, let's get started!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>First of all, there are some ingredients that you will need. And those ingredients are:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Water&nbsp;</li><li>Distilled white vinegar&nbsp;</li><li>Detergent&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Cotton pads&nbsp;</li><li>And brush&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1: Know the material</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first step will be to know the type of the stained cloth. There are several types of cloth available. Not all cloth is of same kind of material. So, you need to search about the quality of the material that is stained.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to check it, you can see the label of that cloth.

That's why you have to know about the cloth, and then get the further procedures done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Removing excess salt</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time to remove the upper level salt first. And if it is wet, then you need to take it the basin.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then Soak it for a few minutes. After that, gently rub the stained area to get the excess salt out of the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if the stain is getting dry, then soak it in water properly. You can use cold water for this purpose. After being soaked for a while, now you need to rub the stained area with a brush to take the upper level salt out from the cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's how you should remove the excess salt easily. And if you do it, then you can get the stain out of the cloth too. Then, it will be much easier than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Soaking&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time for soaking. This part is important because if you soak the area nicely, then it will automatically let the stain come out from the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, that's why soaking is important. And for soaking, you should add detergent into it. Take water and detergent powder and make a nice and foam-like mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should take detergent according to the amount of clothes you are washing. If you have a lot of clothes, then you will need a lot of detergent. On the other side, if you have less amount of cloth, then you will need less amount of detergent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, make that mixture nicely. And after that, take the cloth and dip it into the mixture. Let it be soaked for a few minutes or about an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you soak this way, chances of setting the stain on cloth will be decreased. That's why you need to remove the stain, but first, you need to soak for a generous amount of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Use vinegar&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At that point, you can add vinegar into it. Or, you can also make a solution of it. That will give you the better results for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all know that vinegar has excellent elements to take the stain out. It will be easier to remove the stain if you soak it into a vinegar mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for making the solution, you need to take one part of vinegar and mix it with three parts of water. Now, take the cloth and dip it into the mixture. You can also use cotton pads to soak that particular area. You need to soak it for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soaking in the solution is necessary, but you need to follow the instructions while doing this. So, you have to be careful about this. And according to that, you have to soak it well in the vinegar solution to get rid of the salt stain completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Washing&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After getting done with soaking, now it's time to wash all the dirt and detergent residue out of it. So, you need to wash those clothes in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You already know that vinegar helps a lot to remove stubborn stains easily. So, after soaking in the vinegar solution, you don't need to give a lot of efforts to that cloth.

There might be the watermelon seeds, juice of it or even small pieces of the fruit that creates stain on the cloth easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to remove these, take the cloth, and gently clean the upper level stain and all the residue with the help of a clean cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There could be several things on the cloth. But one thing you have to make sure and that is to avoid rubbing the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And with a gentle motion, get the dirt out of the fabric.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2:  Basic Rinsing   </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you have to rinse the cloth using plain water. It will help to wash off the upper level dirt easily. Also, it will help to minimize the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why you should rinse the stained area as soon as possible. And doing it will be easier to get rid of the stain properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You don't have to use any ingredient or do any scrubbing at this point. You just need to gently rinse it with water to get the excess fruit out of the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use two kinds of methods for this. First, you can do blotting. You can blot the stained area with a paper towel after cleaning it with plain water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other side, you can clean it with water by holding the cloth as well as the opposite side of the cloth under a running water so that, the dirt and the juice of watermelon can come out from cloth easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another thing you need to be careful about is that the stain won't spread to the other parts of the cloth. So, be aware of the thing while rinsing.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Use Stain Remover</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After rinsing off the cloth, now you have to do the main cleaning to remove stain completely. And to do it, use stain remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you have to take careful steps while using it. It is because it can work differently if you won't be careful about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For using it properly, take the cloth and use enzyme-based stain remover on that area. Take a generous amount of that remover to use in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take dishwashing liquid or normal detergent to apply on the surface. Make sure you use enzyme-based product because it is good to break down the stain in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Soaking</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it’s time for soaking. This part is important because you can get the results according to the soaking process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you are done with applying the detergent and stain remover, now you have to focus on the soaking. Take the cloth and leave it in a bowl to soak it nicely. You have to let it be soaked for about 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And while soaking, you need to make sure of another thing. And that is to ensure that the stained area will be soaked properly with the detergent and the stain remover solution. That's how you have to do the soaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Washing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are done with soaking, now you need to do washing to completely clean it. And for doing that, you can use washing machine.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you have to check the details of the materials of that cloth first. The reason is, not all types of clothes have the quality to be washed in a machine. So, must see the labels, and then wash it in a machine if it is washable.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if it is not washable, then you can wash it in a basic way. Hand washing will also work well. So, take the cloth and rinse it once to get all the excess out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, rinse and wash again to get the perfect cleaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Add Bleach</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you apply the previous method, you can hope to get rid of the watermelon stains. But if the stain is still not gone yet, then you can apply another technique to the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for that, you will need to make a solution. Take oxygen-based bleach, and mix it with warm water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take the cloth and dip it into the mixture. One thing you have to careful while using bleach, and that is the measurements and quantity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are going to use bleach, you need to be very careful. Take a generous amount of bleach, and add hot water to minimize the side effects of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after being sure about all these things, now you can allow the cloth to submerge into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 7: Soaking&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after apply the mixture, you have to let the cloth to soak. And you will need much time for doing this.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Generally, you should soak the cloth into the bleach mixture for about 3-4 hours. It will be better if you do the process at night, and let it be soaked overnight.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 8: Washing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are done with soaking, now you can see the stains come out easily. At that time, your application is almost done.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you need to wash it well to get the entire bleach out of the fabric. And to do the washing, simply take the cloth, and rinse it with water for once.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, you need to wash it again. That will ensure the perfect washing of the cloth. And you will be sure that no residue of the solution will be present in it. So, wash it well with room temperature water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 9: Drying</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not just washing is enough. You have to dry the cloth well after washing. It is necessary because if you won't do it then the cloth might leave a bad smell. Also, it might create germs that hampers your hygiene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, drying is also important. And to dry the cloth well, you can use a dryer. But not all kinds of material of cloth can take the electric drying process. And it might harm the cloth texture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's the reason, you need to be sure before doing it. But you can also use another natural technique that will cause zero harm to the fabric. And that is to air dry it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also dry the cloth for a short time under the sun. That will make the cloth germ-free and hygiene.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 10: Repeat</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These steps are enough to remove the watermelon stains from cloth. But last thing you need to know that you should repeat the methods if needed.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Repeating those processes is important only if you find that the stains are not gone yet. And at that time, you have to repeat the procedure until the stains are completely gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Pro Tips For Removing Watermelon Stains From Clothes</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Avoid wetting the cloth for a long time&nbsp;</li><li>Do not use too much hot water because it can damage the cloth&nbsp;</li><li>Apply a gentle way while rubbing&nbsp;</li><li>Do not let the cloth under the sun for too long&nbsp;</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<h2>Final Verdict </h2>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The techniques are easy.

To know more about it, let's check the proper descriptions first!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>1. Dried Stains</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first method that you should know is the method that can get the dried juice stain out of the cloth. It is a difficult task because when the fruit juice dries out on the cloth, it will get fixed. And at that time, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stain_removal\" class=\"rank-math-link\">removing the stain</a> of it will be difficult. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why you need to know the exact and effective process of doing the removing. Let's check the method to have a clear vision about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step1: Scrape off </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the fruit juice is dried out on cloth, it will be difficult to remove. At that time, not only soaking work but also you have to scrape the dried juice first.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do it, you will need a knife. A butter knife or a spoon will be better for this purpose. Take the knife or the spoon and slightly take the dried pulp out of the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to be very careful while doing it. The reason is, the knife can cut the cloth easily. So, you need to take careful steps if you use a general knife.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why we recommend you to use butter knife, a scraper or a spoon to do this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Flush with Water </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After finishing the scrapping, you will need water to flush out all the excess pulp out of the cloth. And to do that, you can do two kinds of things. You can take water in a bowl, and rinse the cloth with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or, you can take the cloth under a running water. That's how all the residue will be gone with the flow of the water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We will recommended you to use the flush motion of water to get rid of the pulp. Make sure you use cold water to do the process. That will help to get the fruit pulp out in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Soaking in Warm Water </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it’s time for soaking. And to soak it, you will need warm water. At this time, you need to use warm water because it will help to get the dried stain out of the cloth. And the removing process will be much easier.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, to do the soaking, at first, you need to know if the cloth is able to take the procedures or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a lot of clothes in different varieties. And not all types of fabrics can take the risk. So, that's the reason you need to check the labels before doing the soaking and the cleaning.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For doing the soaking, you will need a bowl to add hot water in it. Then, take the cloth and submerge into it in a nice way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Allow it to soak for a couple of hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Soaking in Detergent Solution </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you see the stains are not coming out properly after soaking into the hot water, then you can apply a different technique. And the technique is to make a solution of detergent and water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the stain is severe, using detergent will be an useful solution. And that's why you need to make it in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make the mixture, take a bowl and pour some water in it. After that, add detergent and mix it well. You can see the bubbly texture of it. And that means the solution is ready.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5:   Washing </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you need to wash the cloth by soaking it in the detergent mixture. It will be better if you soak it in the mixture overnight. That will take all the stains out of the cloth easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also use warm water at this time. Just make sure the stains are gone. And if you follow the techniques properly then you can remove the stains in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, make sure the cloth is nicely soaked and then you can do the next steps.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Drying </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After being done with washing the cloth properly, now you need to dry it well. It is because if the cloth is not dry enough, it won't keep the hygiene. And to make it germ-free, you need to dry it well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to dry it, you can hang the cloth in the sun ray to become totally germ-free. Also, you can air dry it. That will be also an effective way to dry.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>2. Fresh Juice Stains</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":548,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/How-To-Get-Fruit-Juice-out-of-Clothes.png\" alt=\"How To Get Fruit Juice out of Clothes\" class=\"wp-image-548\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the juice stain is completely fresh, then it will be easier to remove it than before. You just need to follow some basic rules properly and you will be all set to do the stain removing.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, to do the removing, let's check the method and see the steps well. That might give you a clear note about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1:  Flush with Cold Water</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, you need to take the upper level stain out of the cloth. And to do it, you just need to use water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take the cloth and dip it into the cold water. Then rinse well to get rid of the stains. You can also rub it a little to take the stain out.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another thing you can do. And that is to take the cloth under a running water. And the upper level stains will be gone in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Make A Solution </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, make a solution for removing stains. And to make it, you will need dishwashing liquid or any kind of liquid soap and vinegar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a bowl and mix these two things together. Make a watery solution of it. So that, it will be easier to soak.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Soaking </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it’s the time to soak the cloth into the mixture. That's why take the cloth and dip it into the bowl of that solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soak it for a couple of hours and check if the stains are gone or not. If you see the stains are not coming out, then you need to soak it for a longer time. But if you see no stains on the cloth, then get into the next steps.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Lemon Juice Application </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the previous solution won't work, you can use another technique. And that is to use lemon juice on the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lime juice has some good enzymes that can remove spots and stains. So, using it will surely bring some good results for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after using the juice and soak it for a few minutes, you need to take the cloth and leave it in the sun to get rid of the stains.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But one thing you need to consider and that is the fabric. Not all types of fabric can take the lime juice process. So, you have to know about this before doing this step.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Washing </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After applying all the techniques on the stains, now you have to wash all the solutions. And to do it, you will need plain water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just take the cloth and rinse well with the normal water. Make sure no detergent or any other kinds of ingredient will exist on the cloth. So, be careful while doing this. All you need to do is to wash the cloth properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Drying </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After finishing washing, now it’s time to dry it properly. The reason is, if the cloth is not dry properly, then it will be unhygienic. Also.

And what the method will be and how it works, let's check!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First step will be blotting. You need to start with blotting the stain by using a clean cloth. And then, try to absorb as much juice as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Blotting is important because you can get all the juice out of the carpet and protect the stain from spreading.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other thing that you should be aware of and that is, you must not scrub the stained area. This might damage the fabric. Just try to lift the stain with the help of a clean cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use any kind of cleaning solution. Just spread it all over the stained area to soak. Make sure you choose a good quality stain remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, you can take lime juice as a solution. Take a spoon and spread the juice to the areas well. And make sure you cover all the areas well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have to make sure that the stained fabric is&nbsp; absorbed with the solution you are using.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you need to let the carpet be soaked properly. You all know that, soaking is important. The reason is, it can take the stain out of the fabric.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The more you soak, the easier the removing process will be. So, make sure you take a plenty of time while doing the entire procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And in that way, soak the carpet well to make sure you won't need to do more to remove the stain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you can gently rub it to get the stain out properly. But make sure you won't rub it too harsh or do any scrubbing process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do that, you can use a spoon. Just a spoon can remove the excess solution and stains too. So, instead of a scrubber, you should use a spoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, it won't damage the fabric of the carpet. And you can rub the stained area in a gentle way. So, rub it in this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 5 </h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing you need to know is, you can also use ammonia or hydrogen peroxide if you think the stain tough to remove with natural home ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These two elements work in their best way possible to remove any kind of stains and spots. Especially, if the juice is of cranberry, then the stain will be tough. And, at this point, you can use any of these Ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But make sure you won't use these elements on wool kind of fabric. Otherwise, you can use it by maintaining some techniques of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 6</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time to wash the area. And to do it, you cannot pour water on it. So, what should you do?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At that time, you will need a spray bottle. Take cold water in that bottle spray all over it to remove the excess.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take another clean cloth and blot with it. This will help to remove all the solution, and the water that are inside the fabric.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after that, leave the carpet there for air drying.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 2: Clean with Detergent and Vinegar </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all know that, vinegar works great for removing any kinds of spots and stains. And detergent is useful for cleaning any kind of fabric in an easy way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, you can guess by it that both ingredients are special ones that can remove juice stains and make it a cleaned one in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You just have to know the procedures and how all the ingredients should be used. That will be enough that you should do at first. So, let's get started!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, you will need a cloth to blot the juice and take out of the carpet. You can also use a paper towel to do this process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, to do it in a proper way, take a paper towel or a clean cloth and blot up as much juice as possible. Make sure, you won't apply any kind of scrubbing motion while doing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just take the cloth and start blotting in a gentle way. You have to make sure that you will take away as much juice as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason is, it will be much easier to remove all the stains if there will be less juice to make more stain. So, blot up the juice in this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it's time to make a solution for the removing. The first solution will be made of detergent and warm water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a generous amount of dishwasher detergent and add a cup of warm water into it. If you can use non-bleach detergent if you have. It will be better for the fabric than the regular one.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after making the solution, now apply it onto the stained area. Let it be there for a few minutes, and then again blot it up with another clean cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After doing it, now you need to make another solution of vinegar. It will be better for the stains. And to make it, you will need about half cup of vinegar and 2-3 cups of water. Make sure you use regular white vinegar for better outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, mix it well to make a solution. Take a spray bottle and pour all the mixture into it. Now, apply this mixture onto those affected areas well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after that you need to let it be soaked for a while. Then, take a cloth and again blot up to absorb all the excess solution from the carpet.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are done with the solutions, now you need to wash all the areas well. You can use a spray bottle and spray all over the area with water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, clean all the water with a cloth. And if the stains are still visible then repeat the steps once again. And for the finishing, leave the carpet to dry in the air well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 3: Use Baking Soda and Shampoo&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't have vinegar or you don't want to use that, then baking soda can be an alternative of this.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is also a great element to get rid of any kind of stains and spots.

After doing that, you should blot up the liquid again. You need to use a clean cloth or a cloth just like before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And you should use a slight pressure to the carpet to while blotting. That will help you to take the juice out quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take a bowl and make a mixture of shampoo and lukewarm water.

Otherwise, it will cost you more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Make the solution&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After arranging all the things in place, now you have to&nbsp; make the solution first. It is because if you do it, then it will be easier to execute the entire process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, at first, mix some absorbent ingredients like baking soda, salt and cornstarch together. These three powdery things need to be mixed together to apply on the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So that, it can absorb the oil easily. Any one type of element will be enough. But mixing the three ingredients will give you better results for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Apply&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, apply the mixture on the affected area well. And you have to make sure that the entire stained area must be covered well with that mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And in that way, you need to apply it in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Soak</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After applying the powdery thing on the area, now you need to leave the saree for soaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you won't use any kind of water on it. The entire area should be covered with only this dry solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you can also add talcum powder with it if you want. It also helps to soak as much oil as possible. Just apply and cover the stain well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And then leave it for several hours. The more you soak, the better the result you get. So, keep that in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Brush off&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After several hours, it's time to brush off the powder. And while doing that, make sure you won't do it in a tough way. Otherwise, the fabric of that precious silk will be damaged.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just be gentle and do the scrubbing in a gentle way possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though the material is delicate, you need to be careful about it. And after fully brush the residues off, you will see the oil stains start fading away.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And when the stain is almost gone, you need to stop doing the scrubbing at that time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Repeat</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you see no such difference, then you need to repeat the processes. Generally, new oil stains are easy to remove. The reason is, the stain is still wet and isn't settle on the fabric well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, it will be easier to remove. But if the stains are old, then it will be difficult to remove. But that doesn’t mean it is impossible. You can try this method on this and get better results.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if the stains are tough, you can do two types of things. The first one is to dry cleaning it. You can do it in laundry by any professional cleaner.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though it is a delicate fabric, we won’t recommend this thing to you. But if you have a dry cleaning kit, then you can do it at home. It will be better to remove stains quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the second suggestion is to make a liquid solution and apply it. And the element is liquid dishwashing soap. Pour some of it on the stains and let it be soaked for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, clean it with water. You can use distilled water for better results. It won't make any water spots on the saree. So, make sure you do it if your stains are stubborn and tough to remove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Step 7: Dry</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The final step will be drying. You can use any kind of dryer for this purpose. Also, you can use hair dryer too if you have no dryer available around you. Both will work in the same way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you do dry cleaning then doing it with the dry cleaning kit will be better. But if it is the other method that you are following, then you can dry using a hair dryer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure the heat doesn't cause any damage to the silk. And if you want any suggestion, then we would recommend you to sun-dry it. As it is silk, drying in the sun will be appropriate than any electric dryer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, the heat of the sun will take away all the remaining stains too. So, it will be the best option for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Pro Tips</strong> For Removing Oil Stains From Silk Saree</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Don’t be too harsh but be gentle on silk fabric&nbsp;</li><li>Take much time for soaking, and it will be the best if you soak it overnight&nbsp;</li><li>Sun-dry is effective but make sure it won't be for too long&nbsp;</li><li>You can take only the stained area and tie it so that, it will be easier to work with that part that is stained&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid using water if possible&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Verdict </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Silk is a classic and delicate material of fabric.

Air-dry the area as usual or use a hairdryer for instant drying. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 4: Laundry Detergent &amp; Vinegar</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't want to use any kind of chemicals on your carpet, then you can use some natural ingredients that are also useful for removing lipstick stains.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All you need is to know what the best natural ingredients are and how you should mix the ingredients properly. We are going to share two of the ingredients that are useful and effective too. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And those are vinegar and laundry detergent. Vinegar helps more to remove the stains easily. And laundry detergent helps to clean overall fabric. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, both ingredients work great. You just need to know the entire process. And for that, check the method step by step. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. Take a spray bottle to make the solution in it. Then, take laundry detergent and vinegar and mix these two things. Add some warm water to it too. Shake the mixture well to make a complete solution. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. Now, spray the mixture on the stained places. You have to be sure that you cover all the areas well with this solution. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. And after covering all the areas, now leave it for some time to soak properly. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. After soaking properly, you have to blot the areas well like the previous methods. And for blotting, take a towel and press it on the surface. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Do the process again until you see the stains start fading out. And, last but not least air dry it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<h3>Method 5: Rubbing Alcohol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rubbing alcohol can be an alternative to the stain remover. If you don't have stain remover around you, then you can use rubbing alcohol instantly.

First of all, take a cotton pad and soak it with rubbing alcohol. Now, apply it to the spots with the help of a cotton pad. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. Now, take a few minutes to soak. That's how alcohol gets into the fabric and takes all the stains out of it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. So, take some time to soak. And when you are done with the soaking, you can not blot the areas. And at that time, you see how the stains are starting to come out from the surface.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. You should repeat the processes if you see there are still stains remaining. And when the surface perfectly cleaned, now dry the area with a dryer. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Why you Should Be Careful Of While Removing Lipstick From Carpet</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are several things that you have to be careful about.

There are a few methods that can be used to remove oil stains from concrete, but one of the most effective is using coke. Coke is a carbonated soft drink that is known for its ability to clean stains. When used on oil stains, coke can break down the oil and remove the stain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, you’ve read that right.

Fortunately, the answer is yes! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coke is often touted as a miracle cleaner for oil stains. But is it really effective?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It contains carbonic acid, a weak acid, but strong enough to remove dirt and oil from surfaces. Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to remove an oil stain with Coke, simply pour some Coke onto the stain and scrub it. The carbonic acid in the Coke will break down the oil while the Coke will remove the stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Depending on how stubborn the stain is, you may have to repeat this process several times. Once the stain has been removed, soak the area in soapy water for a few minutes to remove any residual Coke.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should test any stain on an inconspicuous area before you use Coke on it. While Coke is an effective cleaner, it can damage some surfaces as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How to Remove Oil Stains from Concrete with Coke?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it’s time for us to go through the process of removing oil stains from a concrete floor or asphalt driveway using coke. Just follow the steps described below, and you’re good to go:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 1:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a can of Coca-Cola that contains roughly 12 ounces of coke. And take a scrub brush made of nylon. Pour the coke over the oil stain and scrub the area using the scrub brush.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might have to use a lot of Coca-Cola if the oil stain is large. And don’t use a wire brush as that could leave scratches on the concrete floor.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next step involves having patience and waiting for half an hour or 40 minutes. During this time, the coke will get soaked into the concrete.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you may be aware, Coca-Cola is a highly acidic beverage. And that’s why it can easily break down oil particles in the oil stain.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then mix a quarter cup of bleach and half a cup of laundry soap with 3 liters of water. And take a mop and dip it into the mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Squeeze out any excess liquid from the mop and start moving the stain with it. And don’t forget to wear gloves while doing this.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 5:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After mopping for some time, the Coca-Cola that was poured on the stain should get cleaned away. If you still see that there is some stain remaining, then repeat this process again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Alternative Methods of Removing Oil Stains from Concrete</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although Coca-Cola is an effective method of removing oil stains from concrete, there are other methods of accomplishing this task. Here are some alternative methods that you could implement:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Baking Soda</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using baking soda is an excellent way of <a href=\"https://learnmethods.com/how-to-remove-oil-stains-from-teak-wood/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">removing oil stains</a>. At first, pour some water over the oil stain and make sure the area gets dampened properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, sprinkle a large amount of baking soda over the affected area. You have to ensure that the area gets completely covered with baking soda.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then fetch some boiling hot water and pour the water all over the oil stain. After that, scrub the area with a brush.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you’re finished scrubbing, pour water over the area and get it clean.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Dish Soap</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don’t have a Coca-Cola can at hand, you could just use regular dish soap or laundry detergent to remove those nasty oil stains from the garage floor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soap and detergent destroy the oil particles and removes them from various types of surfaces.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use dish soap or a detergent solution to scrub the stained surface. This process takes a long time, but after scrubbing thoroughly, you’ll see excellent results.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you’re done, pour some water over the surface to get rid of the soap or detergent.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Engine Degreaser</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the oil stain is old, then you’ll have a hard time removing it. And the methods that we have mentioned above might not work.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If that is the case, you might have to invest in an engine degreaser. These chemicals are specially made for removing oil from different types of surfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just use a scrub or a brush to scrub the oil stain and simply pour some water over it afterward. The surface should be squeaky clean in no time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hopefully, you have found this article informative and helpful. Not gonna lie; Coca-Cola is a wonderful tool in removing oil stains from concrete floors or asphalt roads.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although we have mentioned some alternative methods of getting rid of oil stains, we still prefer the Coca-Cola method. The coke's acidity will eat the stain away and provide you with a nice, clean garage.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, we would like to wish you the best of luck in getting rid of that ugly oil stain from your garage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

At first, take some dish soap or regular soap and some laundry detergent. Then mix it with some warm water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And don’t forget to use only a small amount of detergent if you have sensitive skin. After that, take a towel or a scrub and dip it in the soap mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then gently rub the towel or the scrub on your hands. Keep rubbing your hands with the towel until the stain gets eradicated.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you have successfully removed the wood stain from your hands, take a moisturizing cream, and apply it to your hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Natural Oils</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Did you know that you can use natural oils to remove wood stain from your skin? By natural oil, we are referring to olive oil, mineral oil, or vegetable oil. Just take a food-grade oil and pour some of it on a tray.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then put your hands on the tray and keep rubbing your hands together with the oil until the wood stain gets removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you’re done, wash your hands-off using a bar of regular soap or a bar of dish soap to remove the natural oil from your hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Mineral Spirits</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember, this method is only effective if you’ve got oil-based wood stains on your hands. You can easily find out whether you have oil-based wood stains by pouring some water on the stained wood.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After determining that you have oil-based wood stains, pour some mineral spirits into a bowl. The bowl has to be made of metal.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, take a clean white cloth and dip it into the bowl and start rubbing your hands with the cloth. As you keep rubbing, you’ll notice that the cloth is getting darker. This will indicate that the stain is getting removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you’re done with the process, pour some moderately warm water over your hands.

Make sure you rinse your hands thoroughly as mineral spirits could cause damage to your skin.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Home Remedies&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might not have been aware of this. But you can actually remove wood stains from your hands using simple homemade remedies. There are a variety of things at your home that you can use to remove wood stains.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For instance, you could use a regular make-up remover or eye make-up remover. These products have mineral oils, glycerine, and alcohol in them.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a piece of cloth or tissue paper and pour some eye make-up remover on it. Then rub your hands with that.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Rubbing Alcohol&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We should remind you of the fact that this method is only effective if you have a water-based wood stain on your hands. Check to see if you have a water-based wood stain by rubbing a cotton ball on your hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the cotton ball gets stained, then that would mean that you have a water-based stain. After you’re done checking, take a small bowl and pour a small amount of acetone or rubbing alcohol on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And don’t worry if you don’t have rubbing alcohol lying around your house. Most of the nail polish removers in the market contain rubbing alcohol in them.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now dip a white cloth on the bowl of rubbing alcohol and start cleaning your hands with the cloth.

But it could also come in handy in removing wood stains from your hands and skin.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although this method is not as effective as the other methods that we have mentioned so far, you could give it a try.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a non-gel type toothpaste and apply a little bit of paste on a cotton ball.

And when you know there is ketchup and it can ruin the entire cloth, then you need to find a way to take it out.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And with the help of a spoon, you can take the wet ketchup out of the cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, take a bowl and squeeze lemon juice on it. Get a proper amount of juice to soak the cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take the cloth and cover all the area with it. You need to use a proper amount of juice on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, leave the area to soak in a proper way.

You need to do it for a few minutes so that the stains can be removed properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do the process again if you think the stains are not properly gone.

And then, sun-dry it as usual.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 4: Vinegar&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also use vinegar instead of using lime juice. Both work in the same way. But as we said before, you just need to know about the process of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason is, if you know the process, then you can work accordingly.

You can use a knife or a spoon or something like that to take that ketchup out.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, pour vinegar onto the stains and cover all the areas well. You need to do it properly because a good outcome depends on proper application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Soak the cloth with vinegar solution for a few minutes. You can also soak the cloth with warm water before applying vinegar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That will be better for getting a proper stain-free cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Scrub it with a toothbrush to get the stains out quickly. So, scrub it for a while. And then, wash the cloth with normal water. Dry it in the sun for better hygiene.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Method 5: Liquid Detergent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The basic method would be the detergent method. Almost all people use this technique and get better results.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't have any of the ingredients we mentioned before, then you can simply use this one.

You need to do that for not spreading the ketchup all over the area.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, it will help to absorb the solution into the cloth if there is no layer of ketchup on it. So, make sure you will do that before applying any solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, dip it into warm water and soak the cloth for a few minutes or for even an hour. It helps to get the stains out of the cloth easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, make a solution of water and detergent. You can also use liquid detergent if you want.

Know the details of <strong>how to remove chapstick stains from clothes.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chapstick includes a lot of thick gel formulated ingredients. And that sticks to the cloth in an easy way. So, it will be quite tough to remove the stains of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, you can remove it if you take some simple yet effective stuff. Let's see what the procedures are, and how it works.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 1: Laundry Detergent</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first method that we are going to share with you is the basic detergent cleaning method. You need to know the entire procedure of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's how you can clean, and remove the stains in a proper way. If you made a disaster, and all the chapstick made a stain on your cloth, then this method will solve your problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let's see what the procedures are.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, you need to take out as much chapstick as possible. And for doing that, you need to take the cloth. And get the upper level chapstick out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use a paper towel to do it. And that's how you need to take the chapstick out of the cloth first.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next thing will be soaking. Take a bucket and add warm water in it. Soaking the cloth in warm water helps to melt the chapstick easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, do it by soaking into warm water. But make sure the water isn't too hot. It should not be that hot or not that cold. You can also check the label of that cloth, and set the temperature according to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the stain is dry, then use a scalpel and take the stain off. You can also use a spoon or knife to do the method. But make sure all the dried chapstick is coming out in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h4>Step 4:</h4></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, you can do two types of things. You can make a solution of detergent, and apply on the stains.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, you can directly pour any kind of liquid detergent or laundry detergent, and water, then soak. Both methods work in the same way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apply any of the methods and keep the cloth for soaking. You have to make sure you soak it for a good amount of time. Otherwise, the stains might not be totally gone.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 6:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After done with the soaking, now, you need to scrub it a little. Do not scrub too harsh to damage the fabric. Just be gentle and scrub the places by using an old toothbrush.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 7 :</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The final step will be the rinsing. You need to rinse the places well to get rid of the detergent residue. And then, air dry it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 2: Stain Remover</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other useful and simple method is to use stain remover. When you see the previous method isn't working out, then you can switch it to the stain remover.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is easy to use and you surely get effective results for sure. That's why you need to use it to get rid of the chapstick stains. See the entire process of using it to be clearer.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first thing will be the scrapping. Take a knife or the back of the spoon and scrape off the dried chapstick out of the stains first.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also wipe it out if the chapstick is not dry enough yet. Just take a paper towel or wet cloth, and wipe the areas as well as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After doing that, you need to soak the area just like the previous method. You will need hot water for this. And that helps to get rid of the stains quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do it correctly, take a bucket and pour hot water on it. It shouldn’t be too hot, but much hot to melt the chapstick stains. And let it soak for 15-20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take it out of the water, and do the next procedures. Take any kind of remover that you could find at any store. And apply to the stained areas well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, allow it to sit for some time. Then, use a toothbrush to scrub the places in a gentle way. And when you are done with the scrubbing, rinse the cloth with cold water to take the excess solution out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The final step will be getting out of the excess water by squeezing it, and allow the cloth to air dry. Sun dry will be appreciated if possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Method 3: Bleach</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the people use bleach as a cleaning agent. And when you are having tough stains like chapstick stains, then you can use bleach on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But one thing that you must be careful about is if the cloth is able to take the bleach or not. And that's why you should check the label of that cloth first, and then use it according to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, without any further delay, let's get into the details first.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just like the previous methods, you also soak the stains into warm water if possible. But if it is not, then you should avoid it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you are using bleach, the soaking method is not required. But you have to be sure you use the proper amount of bleach for getting a better result.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apply chlorine bleach on the stains, and cover the stains well. But if the fabric doesn’t allow it then use color bleach. It will also give you the same outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it's time for soaking. And for doing it, you need to take at least 15-20 minutes to soak it properly. After that, you can get to the next procedures.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>See if it removes all the stains or not. If not, then you can scrub for better results. And after doing it, rinse it, and wash the entire cloth in a proper way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that, allow the cloth to air dry or sun dry if possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h2>Tips For Chapstick Stains From Clothes</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Do not use too much hot water&nbsp;</li><li>Have much time to soak the stains properly&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid scrubbing too hard, and for a long time&nbsp;</li><li>Use gloves while using chemicals or bleach&nbsp;</li><li>See the label of the cloth before using bleach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Verdict&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are the things that we have described to you.

There are some basic but useful methods that you need to know. The methods are:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Baking soda to soak the stain&nbsp;</li><li>Remove with vinegar water</li><li>Laundry stain remover helps more!&nbsp;</li><li>Liquid detergent to wash out well&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see, there are four different methods you can use to remove chapstick from your clothes, you can choose any of them that is available.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All you need is proper instruction. And to have a complete idea, check out the detailed description that we are going to show you. Let's see the four different methods and the entire process of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Baking Soda To Soak The Stain </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first method is the baking soda solution. Baking soda is an ingredient that has good properties to soak all the grease of the chapstick.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's how you can get the stain out of your cloth. But first, know the proper way to use the soda. And to know the exact way, let's see the overall method step by step.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. The first thing will be the application of baking soda. Sprinkle some soda on the stains and let it sit for some time. You need to take a proper amount of it to cover all the stains properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. After that, take a stiff brush to scrub the area well. And when you scrub the dry baking soda on the stained places, you see the stains start fading away. The reason is the soaking process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Keep repeating it until you see most of the stains are coming out. And when you see the differences, then stop doing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. After doing the scrubbing for a few minutes take all the soda out of the cloth. And then wash it in a detergent solution. That's enough to get a stain-free cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Remove With Vinegar Water</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another method that you can apply is also easy. And for doing it, you need vinegar. You can use white vinegar as it's generally available in the house. But, if you can you should choose the dark one.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason is, it removes stains effectively. So, decide what you can do and then apply according to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter what ingredient you choose, you need to know the basic technique of using it. And when it’s about removing chapstick stains, you should follow some rules. So, let's see what these are.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. First, you should make a solution. And to make it, you need to mix vinegar and water. That's the two-ingredient that you need to make a liquid solution to apply on the stains.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. So, apply the solution to the cloth. Cover all the places well. Also, shake the mixture well before applying.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. After properly applying the mixture, now you need to take some to soak the areas properly. Leave the cloth with the vinegar solution for a few minutes. That helps the stains to get removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. When you are done with the soaking, now you need to wash it with cold water. You can use detergent to wash properly. Or, you can just rinse it in the running water.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Sun-dry it to make it hygiene. And that is it!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Laundry Stain Remover Helps more! </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Any kind of stain remover will be an effective ingredient. You can choose any of the stain removers that you like. But make sure it ensures a good outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can check the reviews to get a proper description of it.

To get the proper idea, let's have a look at the detailed description to know the exact procedures of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. Firstly, take the cloth and apply the generous amount of stain remover to it. Make sure you apply the remover properly. All the chapstick stained areas must be covered.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. Now, take some time to get rid of the stains. Let the remover sit on the stains accurately. And for that, you need to have some patience. Take time, and soak the cloth properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. After getting the cloth completely soaked, now you need to scrub the areas well. And for doing it, you need a brush. Do not use hard ones for doing the scrubbing. It can damage the fabric.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Repeat until the stains are gone. And when you see this, at that time, you need to wash all-over the area. Sundry it and have a stain-free cloth like before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4. Liquid Detergent To Wash Out Well </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't have the previous ingredients available in your house, then you can apply the basic method of all. If you apply it properly, then you can surely get better results.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other reason for using this process is, you can do it in a shorter time. That's why you can try it if you are in a hurry.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get a better idea of this method, follow the detailed description that we are going to share with you.

Take the bottle and spray the mixture all over the area. You need to spray well. Make sure, there is no place remaining that is not soaked in this mixture.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Let the cloth sit for at least half an hour. The more you soak, the better result you get. So, keep that thing in your mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. After being completely soaked, now you need to scrub the areas a little. That helps to take the remaining stains out of the cloth. Use a gentle brush to do this process.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Wash out all the excess ingredients with cold water. And lastly, dry it in the sun.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Be Careful of Some Facts While Removing Chapstick</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not the processes are enough to get rid of the stains properly.

So, you need to check if the juice doesn't discolor the carpet.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. If you see there is no discoloration occurring, then you can get into the next procedures. And to do that, you need lemon juice. Make sure the juice is completely undiluted. Pour lemon juice on the stains. Cover all the areas well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Now, take a generous amount of time to soak it in the carpet properly.

Repeat the spraying another 2-3 times. Make sure the entire surface should be properly coated.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Now, take a towel and place it on the stained surface. After that take an iron and heat it properly.

We know that tape residue contains a sticky texture that is a bit tough to remove it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you take some right steps, and apply it in a right way then you can easily remove it. There are several types of materials. And according to that, the method will be different from each other.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's why you need to know what the techniques are and <strong>how to remove tape residue</strong> by executing it properly. Let's jump into the section to clear this out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Basic Method</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ultimate method is to completely wash with dish-washing soap and rubbing alcohol. Let's see the method step by step.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>And to do it, you will need: </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Rubbing alcohol</li><li>A pen knife</li><li>Dish-washing soap</li><li>Warm water&nbsp;</li><li>And a soft cloth&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 1: Scrape the Residue</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, take a pen knife or you can also use butter knife or any kind of blade-like thing instead of it. Then hold the blade on the sticky surface and slide the knife over it. That will help to scrape off the residue quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But make sure you won't do the scraping in a fast way. That might damage the material. And don't scratch the surface too. Scraping is the best option in this case.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 2: Soaking</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, take a soft cloth and dip it into rubbing alcohol. After that, rub it on the sticky surface, so that the area will be soaked nicely. You can also use nail polish remover or acetone if you have no rubbing alcohol around you.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 3: Scrubbing</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take a bowl and add about one tablespoon of liquid dish-washing soap and two cups of warm water. Mix it well to get a proper liquid solution. Now, take another soft cloth and dip it into the solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Keep rubbing the place with the cloth. After some time, you can see the stickiness coming out of the surface, and it will feel slippery. At that time, you need to stop the rubbing procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Step 4: Wiping out</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the stickiness comes out, now take another clean cloth and wiping the surface out nicely.

But for having a good winged line on your eye, you need to know <strong>how to sharpen eyeliner pencils</strong> properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, it's a bit tricky to do that. First of all, you need good skills. Second of all, you need a good liner. And when you are using a pencil liner, you need to sharpen it quite often to have a perfect sharp tip.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have less skill of doing winged line then it won't be an issue. You just have to have a sharp tip line. That's why you need to know what will be the easy and effective way to get the perfect trip. Let's get right into the details to get the idea and some interesting hacks too.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Method of sharpening eyeliner pencil</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sharpening any kind of pencil is simple. So does eyeliner pencil. But there are some tricks that we are doing to share with you so that you will get much benefit than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, without any further delay, let's get in.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 1: Freeze first</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first step will be freezing the pencil. Yes, it needs to be done properly. It's a great trick because it will make the pencil harder than before and you will sharpen it without any breakage.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for doing it, but that pencil in the freezer for 5-7 minutes. But if you have an eyeliner pencil that is thicker in size then you need to freeze it for a longer time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doing it is important because it will help to do the upcoming procedures smoothly. Also, if the pencil is hard then there will be no chance of breaking while sharpening. So, freeze it well before getting into the other part.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 2: Use rubbing alcohol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another trick to get a perfect sharpening is using rubbing alcohol. Yes, you heard it right. It has a great benefit as it has a disinfecting quality.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not for the sharpening, but for sanitizing, this will be an effective one. But what would you sanitize? You need to use the rubbing alcohol to sanitize the sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though you are going to sharpen an eyeliner pencil, you need to be very careful about hygiene. And though it's about your eyes and you are going to use this liner for defining your eyes, you need to ensure the hygiene and safety of your sensitive eye.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to do it properly, all you need is a cotton bud. Take a cotton bud and dip it into the rubbing alcohol. And then, it's ready to use.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 3: Clean the sharpener</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cotton bud that you have soaked into the disinfecting rubbing alcohol, now you need to use it in this purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before getting into any sharpening process, you need to clean the sharpener first. And that's why you need to apply this technique too.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take the soaked cotton bud and start cleaning the sharpener properly. There could be some pencil residue that must be cleaned. Also, rubbing alcohol helps to disinfect the entire sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, do the cleaning by gently swabbing. If the first bud will get dirty, then you can take the other one. Use buds by soaking properly according to your need. That's how clean both inside and outside areas of the sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 4: Take the eyeliner out of the free freezer</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After 5 minutes of freezing, now take the pencil out from the freezer. You will feel the hardness of it when you are touching the frozen eyeliner.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But if you feel it's not that much hard and it's almost the same as the non-frozen one, that's mean it's not done yet. At that time, you need to freeze it again. Put it in the freezer and again after 5 minutes, check if it's done or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It actually depends on the hardness of the pencil. Freeze it until you feel the hardness. Remember, the eyeliner pencil should be harder than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 5: Insert the pencil </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After being done with cleaning the sharpener, now it's time to do the sharpening. And to do that, you can use any kind of sharpener like a regular pencil sharpener. It will do the sharpening in an easy way.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for that, just simply insert the pencil into the hole of the sharpener. Make sure you clean it properly. It is because if the sharpener is cleaned properly then it will be easier to do the next step. Otherwise, the pencil won't be fit into the hole if there is any dirt inside it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take the pencil, and simply insert it. Don't force the pencil because it might break if you do that. Just press the pencil, and it will easily slide into that hole.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 6: Start the sharpening</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it's time to sharpen the pencil with a sharpener. After inserting it, all you need to do is to rotate the pencil. Keep rotating it in a circular motion for at least a couple of times. Or, you can do it until you see the tip of the pencil is sharp enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, you can rotate a full circle, and then check. And if the tip of the pencil isn't sharp yet then do another rotation, and then check again. Repeat this process until you get a perfect sharp tip.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, after a full rotation, take out the shavings. That's how it will be easier to see inside it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 7: Pull out </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>when you are satisfied with the outcome, now you can stop doing the rotating. Make sure the tip is well-sharped.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And after completing the sharpening, simply take the pencil out from the sharpener. Don't rush and steadily pull the pencil out of that sharpener.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure you are fully satisfied with the result. But if you don't, then insert it and repeat the same procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to know that eyeliner pencils should not be excessively sharp. It is because it might hurt your eyes. That's why sharping it by keeping this fact in mind is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 8: Shaping</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After sharpening by using a sharpener, you can give it an extra finish if you want. And you can do it by using a knife or a regular blade.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, you can also use this method if you have no sharpener around you. All you need is a pen knife or an X-acto knife.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for doing it, simply take the knife and hold it on the tip of the pencil. Make sure you hold the knife in your dominant hand and the pencil in your non-dominant hand. You have to hold the pencil downward and sharpen it with the knife in a steady motion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don't rush. Doing it in a fast way might do injury. Keep calm and sharpen it according to your choice.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 9: Repeat if necessary</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have told earlier that if you think you need another rotation to sharpen the pencil again, do it. Don't do several rotations at a time. It might extremely sharpen the tip and thus, break easily.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead of doing it, sharpen with a single rotation and pull the pencil out to check if it's done or not. Again press the pencil into the hole and sharpen by rotating if it's not done. Repeat this process until you get your desired sharpness.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 10: Testing </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are done with your sharpening, now you have to test it on your hand first. Always remember, don't use the pencil directly on your eyes after sharpening it. The reason is, the sharp tip might hurt your eyes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, it would the best if you test it first so that you will see the pigmentation and can use it according to it. Also, you can see if the sharp tip works appropriately or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for doing the test, draw a line on your back of your hand. See if you are satisfied with it or not. And if you aren't then repeat the process again. Moreover, see the thickness is perfect or not. Overall, see everything and manage the texture according to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Step 11: Final cleaning</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After finishing all the things of sharpening, now you have to clean the sharpener again. It's necessary because the sharpener should be germ-free. Also, if you keep it clean then it will be easier when you use it next time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for cleaning, take another cotton bud and throw all the shavings away in a garbage bin. Also, clean the blades, and knives too. You can also use rubbing alcohol to clean it in a proper way. After properly clean the sharpener, take and store it in a certain place.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Pro Tips</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Try to purchase that eyeliner that has a sharpener with it.&nbsp;</li><li>Sharpen the pencil at least once in a week to get the defined line every time you use it.&nbsp;</li><li>You can keep an emery board to sharpen anytime you need it.&nbsp;</li><li>Try to do the sharpening over a bin or any kind of trash can so that the shavings will fall directly into it.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hope that you will learn something from this method. This is not an extraordinary method, but we tried to give you some hacks, so that, you can get better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, though eyes are the most sensitive part of our body, you need to be very careful while doing these methods. Maintain hygiene and then sharpen.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall, it's not tough to sharpen eyeliner pencils but make sure you follow the tricks. So, you can get the desirable wings, and look pretty as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

When used right, WD-40 can effectively cleanse shower doors with ease but it should be treated with a bit of caution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First and foremost, you must wear hand gloves and eye protection when working with WD-40.

That's why we have created a step-by-step guide on how to do that. Our goal is to provide you with the information and tools you need to have a more successful cleanup of your home from smoke damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With that said, it's important to have an understanding of what exactly happens to a home after it has been damaged by a fire. We will start with the fundamentals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let's begin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":915,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/How-to-Clean-Smoke-Damage-from-Painted-Walls.jpg\" alt=\"How to Clean Smoke Damage from Painted Walls\" class=\"wp-image-915\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h2><strong>How to Clean Smoke Damage from Painted Walls</strong></h2></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;If you’ve had the misfortune of having smoke damage to your house or a building, it can be a very difficult and time-consuming task to remove it. The best way to do this is to remove the smoke damage using the following methods:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h4><strong>1.Make Sure That the Area Is Well Ventilated</strong></h4></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure that you have ventilated your house properly. The harsh fumes left by the fire can be detrimental to your health. And if the fumes get mixed with the cleaning products, it can cause breathing difficulties.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, we suggest you open up all the windows and<strong> doors, and make sure there is no smoke, which will make the area a better environment for cleaning</strong>. Use fans to get the fumes out of the house.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>2. Wear Protection</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best way to prevent any kind of injuries while cleaning smoke damage from painted walls is by wearing safety goggles as well as gloves. When you wear your gloves, your hands will be protected from the chemicals of the cleaning products. And the goggles will make sure you don't get soot in your eyes while cleaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>3. Cover the Floor with a Drop-Cloth</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most effective methods of protecting your carpet or flooring from getting stained is by placing a drop-cloth over them. This will prevent any stain from reaching the floor while cleaning the walls.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>4. Remove the Loose Soots from the Painted Walls</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before you start cleaning those nasty stains from your walls, it would be easier to take out the loose soots that cling to the wall. You could either use a vacuum cleaner or a regular sponge to do this. But, using a vacuum cleaner will make the process much faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, get the plain attachment fixed on the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner. Then move it back and forth over the wall to get rid of the loose soot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>5. Remove the Smoke Damage Using Trisodium Phosphate Solution</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After removing the soot from the wall, you can start by cleaning the smoke damage. To do this, use a powerful cleaning solution such as TSP (Trisodium Phosphate). This cleaning solution is quite popular when it comes to cleaning damage off painted walls.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, fill a bucket with a gallon of warm water and then add one teaspoon of trisodium Phosphate. Then dip a wet sponge into the solution and vigorously clean the walls of the ceiling of your house. This will get rid of the smoke damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might have to keep doing this multiple times and this step is quite tedious. So, we suggest you have patience and take breaks while doing it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And also make sure you don't overdo it. If you use too much water, then it could seep into the walls and that could cause problems in the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the stains still persist even after thoroughly cleaning the walls with the TSP solution, you should try other cleaning solutions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>6. Look for Other Types of Cleaning Solutions</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are various types of commercial cleaning solutions in the market that are specifically made for removing soot from painted walls. If you think that the TSP solution is a bit too strong to use around children and pets, you should look for better alternatives.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>7. Remove the Smoke Odor</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You may not have considered this, but just cleaning the smoke damage won't be enough. When a painted wall gets damaged by smoke, it releases a burned smell. The reason for that is, walls can easily absorb smoke and it then leaks the smoke back to the room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To remove the smoke odor from the walls, you should at first place a large plastic sheet around the base of the walls. Then make a detergent solution out of warm water and two tablespoons of detergent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, gently wipe the walls down with the detergent mixture on the walls using a soft rag or a sponge. You can also use vinegar to get rid of the smoke odor from the walls.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you're finished, spray Febreeze on the walls as well as the surrounding area.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Can smoke damage be removed?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, it’s possible. In fact, the procedure for cleaning smoke damage is pretty straightforward. Just make sure that you do not leave smoke damage behind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How do you get the smoke residue out of the house?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to get rid of the smoky smell from your house, you need to at first open all the windows and increase air circulation throughout the rooms. And then spray an air freshener.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Does sugar soap remove smoke damage?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, it does. Sugar soaps are typically used for cleaning nicotine off painted walls. Just clean the walls using sugar soap and leave it for 30 minutes. Then rinse them off using water.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How do you get black smoke off walls?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use TSP, vinegar, or a degreasing dish soap in order to remove smoke damage from walls. You can also buy a commercial smoke remover in order to accomplish that task.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What's the best cleaner for smoke damage?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use any cleaner that you like on your walls. However, we'd recommend you use a tri-sodium phosphate solution to remove the smoke damage on the walls.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is absolutely no question that smoke damage causes a lot of problems for a resident. The cost of cleaning the smoke damage can be very expensive and most homes aren't equipped to deal with this issue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, you can eliminate smoke damage from your walls by following our guide about \"How to clean smoke damage from painted walls\".

Sounds tricky, right?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Typically, window air conditioners come with two different covers that protect the internal components of the AC.

Well, that is the question that comes to mind whenever you see burnt grease at the bottom of your frying pan or skillet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what to do? Is my skillet totally ruined beyond all repair? I hear you ask! Don’t worry, it's not completely destroyed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You'll just need to clean the bottom of your frying pan to be rid of the brown grease.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are several different ways to clean the bottom of a frying pan. For instance, you can use vinegar, baking soda, ketchup, salt, etc. to clean the gunk from under your skillet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em><strong>Let's discuss them in detail.</strong></em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":917,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/How-to-Clean-Burnt-Grease-from-Bottom-of-Frying-Pans.jpg\" alt=\"How to Clean Burnt Grease from Bottom of Frying Pans\" class=\"wp-image-917\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Clean Burnt Grease from Bottom of Frying Pans</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having a frying pan with a burnt underside can be quite problematic. The reason why this happens is that your cooking oil has burnt the grease underneath, thus preventing proper cooking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It might seem impossible to remove all that greasy mess from your frying pan. Even hours and hours of scrubbing can prove ineffective against the grease. But, if you have the proper knowledge about the matter, you can easily clean your skillet. And that's what we are here to discuss.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To clean the bottom of your frying pan, you'll first need to gather all the necessary tools for this procedure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Here are the items you will need to perform the cleaning task:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Sea salt</li><li>Baking Soda</li><li>Vinegar (White)</li><li>Scrubbing pad/brush</li><li>Dish Soap</li><li>Ketchup</li><li>Toothbrush</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The various methods of removing burnt grease from the bottom of a frying pan are illustrated below:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>1. Baking Soda</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Baking soda is an extremely versatile substance that's highly effective in removing grease from frying pans. Here are the steps for removing grease by using baking soda:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Mix baking soda with hydrogen peroxide and water. Add some dawn to it if you can.</li><li>Use the scrubbing pad to apply this mixture to the bottom of your skillet.</li><li>Thoroughly move the scrubbing pad around the bottom of the pan and make sure the paste gets into every nooks and cranny.</li><li>Let it sit for half an hour. And once the paste gets all dried up, scrub the paste out using a toothbrush.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>2. White Vinegar</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The grease is bound to form on the outside part of your frying pan. This is especially true if you use the pan on a regular basis.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the good news is that you can use white vinegar to remove that grease. And white vinegar is a common household item. So, this method shouldn't be that difficult for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Take a large bucket that can fit the frying pan inside.</li><li>Mix white vinegar with water with a ratio of 1:2.</li><li>Submerge the skillet inside the mixture and let it sit for 30-40 minutes.</li><li>If the grease persists, keep it submerged for an additional 20 minutes.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>3. White Vinegar, Dish Washer Liquid, and Baking Soda</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Both of the cleaning agents that we have described so far are effective in their own right. But you know what will make an even more powerful cleaner?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All you have to do is mix those two with some dishwashing liquid. Here's what you need to do:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Cover the frying pan's surface with baking soda.</li><li><strong>Pour </strong>a few drops of white vinegar and a few drops of dishwashing liquid over the frying pan's bottom surface.</li><li>Let it sit for a few minutes.</li><li>Wash the surface with a wet sponge.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>4. Ketchup</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, now that you've got all the basic cleaning agents covered, you just need to learn about some unorthodox ways to clean greasy frying pans. <strong>I'm sure you</strong> didn't know that ketchup could be used to clean frying pans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fair warning! This method only works if the pan only has a thin layer of burnt grease on it. <strong>I've tried using this</strong> technique and I was successful in this ende<strong>avor</strong>. Here are the steps:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Cover the entire bottom surface of the skillet in ketchup.</li><li>Let it sit overnight. It takes a lot of time for the ketchup to remove the burnt grease.</li><li>Scrub the surface and then rinse it.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>5. Salt</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have some kosher salt (coarse) lying around in the kitchen, then you can use it to<strong> clean your fry pan.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Sprinkle some kosher salt on the greasy surface.</li><li>Add some lemon juice or soapy water to it.</li><li>Cut a potato in half and use it to scrub the surface and once you're done rinse it.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>6. White Vinegar and Salt</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another way to clean greasy coating from your skillets is to use a mixture of white vinegar and salt. This method is quick and easy. This method works best if you mix a little bit of dishwashing liquid into it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Keep the skillet soaked in white vinegar for more than an hour.</li><li>Pour the kosher salt over it and add a few drops of dishwashing liquid.</li><li>Vigorously scrub the bottom surface.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>7. Oven Cleaner &nbsp;</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I bet you didn’t know that oven cleaner can be used to clean grease from kitchen appliances. Although most people hesitate to use oven cleaner to clean skillets, it’s actually quite effective at removing stubborn grease. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here is how you can use it to clean your frying pan’s bottom surface:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>At first, take the spray bottle filled with oven cleaner spray it all over the bottom surface of the skillet.</li><li>Leave it like this overnight (for at least 12 hours). This will give the oven cleaner enough time to break down the grease particles.</li><li>After that, use a scrub to clean the loosened grease. You can use a damp cloth or a sponge for that.</li><li>After you’re done scrubbing, you have to thoroughly wash the frying pan so that no burnt grease is left on its bottom surface.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h2><strong>Tips for Cleaning Burnt Grease of Frying Pans</strong></h2></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want to keep your frying pan in the best possible condition, you should follow the tricks given below:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>You should soak the skillet in water as soon as you’re done cooking your meal. This will make it easy for you to clean the grease.</li><li>Put a coat of ketchup on the surface of the frying pan in order to make it shiny.</li><li>Refer to the instruction manual and follow the instructions given by the manufacturer in order to maintain your frying pan properly.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, did you find our methods of cleaning burnt grease interesting and helpful? Hopefully, our guide on how to clean burnt grease from bottom of frying pans has helped you understand that the process is not as complicated as it seems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But we should warn you, it might not work on the first try and you may need to use different techniques to accomplish this task. Still, you should remember, no matter how tough the grease is, it will definitely break down at some point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

But that can be quite expensive, and there is a much cheaper solution and that is washing your shoelaces. So, we're going to go over how to clean white tennis shoes using a couple of different methods.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":909,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/How-to-Clean-White-Shoelaces-by-Using-a-Washing-Machine-1024x581.jpg\" alt=\"How to Clean White Shoelaces by Using a Washing Machine\" class=\"wp-image-909\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to Clean White Shoelaces by Using a Washing Machine</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Washing your tennis shoelaces using a washing machine is a simple procedure. Simply follow these steps to make your white shoelaces as clean as possible:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>1.Take the Laces Out of the Shoes</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You cannot clean your tennis shoes while having the shoelaces on them. They must be cleaned separately. And so, your first step is to remove the laces from the shoes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>2. Rinse the Shoelaces</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>After taking them out of the shoe, you can rinse the laces in hot water for a minute or so. (Do not use soap or </strong>any other cleaning products <strong>to clean the laces</strong>) This is done to remove the surface soil from them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>3. Pretreat the Shoelaces</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This step is essential for cleaning your shoelaces properly. Take an old soft-bristled toothbrush and dip it into liquid detergent or stain remover. Put the laces on a flat surface and brush the detergent on both sides of the laces.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Laundry detergents have the enzymes that are necessary for breaking the stains and grimes apart. These enzymes break down the dirt and grime so you can clean up the excess residue before putting the laces inside the washing machine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>4. Put Them Inside a Mesh Type Laundry Bag</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You wouldn't want your shoelaces to be all tangled up inside the washer, would you? And that's why you should put them inside a mesh laundry bag in order to prevent that from taking place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>5. Use the Washer</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next step is to use the washer to wash the laces. You may have to add a small amount of detergent to the wash cycle to make sure that the laces are thoroughly washed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, remember to wash the shoelaces with your white laundries such as white sheets, underwear, and towels. That's because white laces can get stained by the colors leaking from colored clothes so you'll want to avoid them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>6. Add Bleach to Them</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should also use bleach to clean the laces so that the bleach can penetrate the fibers and help get the stains out. Bleach can also be added as a last resort if you think that the shoelaces are not white enough.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I recommend adding some bleach to them just in case so you don't end up with a bunch of white laces that look dirty.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're dealing with cotton laces, you should add one tablespoon of bleach into warm water (2 cups). Then put the laces into that solution and let them soak for 10 minutes. This will allow the bleach to work on the fibers and leave the laces in good condition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h3><strong>7. Hang Them Up to Dry</strong></h3></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You're almost done! All you have to do now is put the laces up on a rack for drip drying. After that, you can take them off to air dry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><h2><strong>How to Clean White Shoelaces by Hand Washing</strong></h2></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What to do when you don't have access to a washing machine? Well, fear not. You can also clean your white shoelaces by hand. I find this method to be the most efficient, and it will also keep your laces in good condition. In order to do this, you will need to follow these steps:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&nbsp;1. Follow the Previous Steps</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While washing your shoelaces by hand, you still have to follow the previous steps that we have mentioned while discussing how you can clean shoelaces using a washer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those steps include removing the shoelaces from your shoes, rinsing the loose soil from the shoelaces, and pretreating the laces with a detergent solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. Make a Cleaning Solution</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fill your sink with 4-5 cups of warm water. Then pour half a tablespoon of a strong laundry detergent into the mix. Slowly stir the mixture until the detergent is completely dissolved. You must double the amount of detergent in case you're dealing with multiple pairs of white shoelaces.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. Immerse the Shoelaces into the Mixture</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it's time for you to submerge the laces into the cleaning solution. And don't forget to move them around the mixture for some time. Once you've finished washing your white shoelaces, remove them from the mixing process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4. Check If They are Clean or Not</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you've got them all clean! All of your white shoelaces have to be re-rinsed with fresh water. And you must also check to see if they are as clean as you expected them to be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If they are still not clean enough, you can use a little amount of bleach to \"fizz \" them up. But the best thing to do is to just leave them in the solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>5. Dry Them Out</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, rinse the white shoelaces with cool water. This will help remove the dirt and detergent on the laces. Then dry them out by letting them drip dry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, there you have it! Your white shoelaces are now ready to wear once more and they should look amazing. This was a very simple process, won't you agree?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hope this guide about how to clean white shoelaces was helpful for you, and that you have fun doing it.

   "Title": "How To Get Rid Of A Mildew Smell In The Shower Drain?",
   "Content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Mildew smell creeping up from the drain in your shower is very common. It can happen after a large amount of water sits in the drain for a while, say when you are on vacation. Even if there isn't that much standing water in the shower, it might just need to be cleaned out to prevent shower drain smells like mildew. There may also be times where you have this problem but don't know why your mildew smell is coming about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then this blog post will help you to catch up with the problem and provide you with an easy and effective way to get rid of the smell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":988,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Get-Rid-Of-A-Mildew-Smell-In-The-Shower-Drain1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-988\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What is the reason behind Mildew Smell?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many reasons why your drain is producing this <a href=\"https://showerpark.com/why-does-my-bathroom-sink-smell/\">unpleasant odor</a>, but the most common cause is simply dirty water sitting in it. Even though we shower every day, some of us don't clean out our drains daily (or even monthly). If there isn't any standing water, then that probably means that your drain is just dirty.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So first off, you need to clean out the shower drain with a snake or plunger before doing anything else. After doing these things, you may be up to a decision on what to do now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, the obvious solution to eliminating this odor is to pour bleach down into the drain and scrub around with a brush. This will kill any bacteria or mold growing inside the PVC pipes leading to the sewer system so that they will no longer release an unpleasant scent throughout your bathroom. However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach\">bleaching</a> these pipes could potentially damage them so it's important to take precautions before doing this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How to clean a smelly shower drain?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your shower drain smells like mildew and wants to get rid of the musty smell perpetually then you'll need to follow down the procedure outlined here-</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Try Hot Water Treatment:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before using soap or bleach mixture, you can try a pot of hot water into the drain. If it is not badly blocked or clogged with hair, then hot water should work well to dissolve any accumulated soap scum and unclog the mildew smell from the shower drain. If it doesn't work then go to the next step.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Remove hair and debris</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hair and debris can cause the drain to become clogged and filled with mold, which can cause an unpleasant mildew smell. So you need to remove hair or other objects that may be obstructing it before anything else.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A great way to do this is by using a plunger. Apply pressure on one side of the drain (preferably where it smells) until all the standing water has gone out of your drain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then put the rubber end of the plunger over the drain opening and push down hard several times in fast succession. Repeat this process for another 10 minutes until no more soap scum comes loose from the pipes down below.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>A mixture of Bleach And Vinegar (Super Effective)</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also try a mixture of bleach and vinegar if your shower drain smells like mildew. It's the best way to clean the mildew smell from your shower drain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Mix 1/2 cup of vinegar and 1/2 cup bleach in a bucket filled with water. Pour this solution into the drain by using a goblet or hand-held plastic funnel.</li><li>Allow it to stay for 15 minutes then you have to flush it off with water running hot through the showerhead.</li><li>For DIY treatments, allow 30 minutes before flushing out any clog and cleaning up the mess.</li><li>If after the half-hour, there is still no improvement (and your drain isn't badly blocked), then try this step a second time. If no result was found, then called professional.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Precautions</strong>: Always wear rubber gloves while cleaning the drain with bleach, vinegar, or bacteria mixture because it can cause irritation to the eyes and skin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":985,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://learnmethods.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Get-Rid-Of-A-Mildew-Smell-In-The-Shower-Drain.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-985\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Clean the Drain Pump Screen:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The drain pump screen is located at the bottom of many types of bathtubs. It's a black, circular mesh-like filter that keeps debris from entering the waste line attached to your home plumbing system. This pump screen is generally removable and easy to clean out if it has lots of accumulated dirt on it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Clean the Drain Trap</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After all the above steps, you can follow down below to clean out the drain trap under the bathroom sink. Remove the p-trap and take it apart carefully.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, remember to replace any rubber washers that may be worn out or missing from around pipe joints before reassembling everything back together.

Regular check:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned above, you need to inspect your drain frequently for stuff that can cause a mildew smell. Hair and soap scum are the main culprits of this problem, so make sure to remove them from time to time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You also need to check if there is any water left in the shower after using it because sometimes small amounts of standing water will invite mold or mildew growth which can produce a bad odor when it's exposed to air.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. Prevent Condensation</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fix any water leaks to help reduce the added moisture condensation that can lead to mildew problems in your bathroom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. Use Fabric Softener Sparingly</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Try not to use too much fabric softener during laundry because it's known for leaving unpleasantly scented residues that attract mildew and mold growths on your bathroom rugs, towels, etc., so try to wash them regularly with detergents without fabric softener.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4. Remove Moisture with a Dehumidifier</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you live in an excessively humid climate, then you can remove moist air using a dehumidifier which will help prevent mold growth in the bathroom where humidity is high enough for these microorganisms to thrive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>5. Take extra care when Wet</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Be very careful when taking wet showers or baths so that water doesn't flood down your drain and create excess moisture inside it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>6. Clean the Drain Trap</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Clean out the drain trap under your sink monthly to remove dirt, hair, soap scum, etc. that will produce a mildew smell if they are not removed regularly. You can also use enzyme-based cleaner/degreaser to break down soap scum, hair, etc., so it's easy to flush out of the drain trap with water.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>7. Use Exhaust Fans</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Install an exhaust fan in your bathroom which is very effective for removing moist air and bad odors coming from mold or mildew growths inside your home plumbing systems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So these are the ways to prevent your Shower Drain from Smells Like Mildew and accomplishing how to get rid of mildew Smell in Drain. Even if you can't follow all the steps mentioned above, at least applying the first two/three methods will help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though it's not a difficult task to deal with the mildew smell coming from your shower drain, if neglected for a long time then it will become more troublesome. So try to maintain good bathroom hygiene by regularly removing any shampoo/soap residues inside the drain, using fabric softener sparingly, etc., so that you don't have to experience the same problem again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are still having trouble after trying out all these methods mentioned above or want some help from professionals for further guidance about bad smelling drains in your city area. Then you can get in touch with Drain cleaning services and they'll ensure quick action to avoid this kind of problem again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

Try to get a cleaner based on ammonia, or specially dedicated to cleaning artificial or natural stone countertops.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Does it leave streaks?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Never get a cleaning product that might leave streaks or residues on the countertop surface while/after cleaning. Be sure to check the cleaner’s specs and see if it passes those. Or, you can get one from the list mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Does it clean other surfaces?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might not have Corian surfaces all over the residence! Being able to clean all surfaces with a single cleaner adds convenience. Not many cleaners can clean all materials. Getting an all-rounder, like Hope's multi-surface cleaner, is great.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Do you love fragrance?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next up, ask yourself: do you want your Corian countertop cleaner to leave a fragrance as you clean the surface? If you do, then go for a cleaner that offers your favorite fragrance. The Sapadilla Countertop Cleanser offers such options to choose from.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What other facilities it offers?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having extra facilities from a cleaner apart from cleaning can be advantageous. For instance, if you get polishing agent, you’re spared from buying extra polishing liquids! Further, UV protection is new to the ground, like the Weiman Cleaner offers!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How To Revitalize Corian Countertops?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Corian countertops are truly the best of their kind, especially when it comes to keeping things safe from germs build-up. However, proper maintenance and revitalizing the countertop is necessary to get the most out of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/V9wbHBdQy5U\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"align\":\"center\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/V9wbHBdQy5U\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are the necessary tips to keep in mind about revitalizing corian countertops once you have dirt or stain on-board:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Use the right cleaners</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Corian countertops are not like other ones that have joints in the middle. Just like they offer smooth solid surfaces, they also need ammonia based cleaners or dedicated ones for countertop only. If you don’t have the right cleaner, make use of soapy warm water. Don’t use abrasive cleaners that might have a bad impact on your countertop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Don’t use glass cleaners?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the manufacturer, <a href=\"https://www.corian.com/-use-care-\">Corian also suggests</a> not to use dedicated glass cleaners to clean Corian countertops. They might leave a waxy stain residue after you finish off the cleaning on the surface of your countertop. If you want a longer lasting countertop with a shiny look to it for years, avoid glass cleaners.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Rub in circular motion</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you have the right cleaner for your Corian countertop, you must use it the right way to get the most out of it. Spray or apply the cleaning solution on the surface, rub the surface for two minutes, and clean it off. Rubbing in circular motion will help you not only penetrate the stain better, but also keep the texture in good shape.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Never leave water to air dry&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One mistake people often make is leaving the countertop to air-dry, which is particularly to be avoided with Corian countertops. Once you have the stain off the counter, use a kitchen towel or tissue to dry the surface. Leaving it in the air may have a stain which might even have a bad mark, only to make it look dull.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Avoid using scouring pads</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have the right cleaner for the countertop, but what about the rubbing material? Many people use scouring pads on their countertops, which is to be avoided with Corian ones! Use a microfiber cloth instead, which will clean the surface much efficiently as well as keeping the surface safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that you know the basic rules and methods of revitalizing your Corian countertop, keep the <a href=\"https://www.corian.com/IMG/pdf/k-26840-corian-solid-surface-care-and-maintenance.pdf\">Corian official maintenance guide</a> with you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\"} -->\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How to remove stains from Corian countertops?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spray a little cleaning agent on the stain or grime and run a sponge (non-abrasive) to loosen the stain. You can also use warm soapy water with Scotch-Brite 7448<strong> </strong>to clean a stubborn stain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What can I use to clean my Corian countertops?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use an ammonia-based cleaner, but regular soapy water and a microfiber clothe also do just fine.

Rub across the scratches without putting much pressure until it’s plain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What should you not use with Corian?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Never use acidic drain cleaners that are made of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid to clean your Corian countertop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How can I make my Corian countertops shine?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can use a countertop polish on your Corian countertop to make it shine like new, even after years. But, be sure not to use abrasive pads, and rub in circular motion while applying.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using Corian countertops means having a seamless, joint-free, and bump-less surface. Cleaning this countertop also needs the right cleaners, which we hope you’ve already found from the list above.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re yet to decide and want us to suggest you the best cleaner for Corian countertops, our go will be with the James Austin countertop cleaner.

For example:\n\nconst input = document.getElementById('myInput');\n\ninput.value = '';\"\n\n        \n        }\n        }\n        ,{\"@type\": \"Question\",\n        \n        \"name\": \"How do you clear props in React?\",\n        \n        \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \n        \"text\": \"\n\nAssuming you are using a basic text input field:\n\nThe easiest way to clear a text input field is by setting the value to an empty string:\n\nthis.state.inputValue = ;\n\nHowever, if you are using a controlled input field, you will need to set the value prop of the input field to an empty string:\n\n<input value={this.state.inputValue} onChange={this.handleChange} />\n\nthis.setState({ inputValue:  });\"\n\n        \n        }\n        }\n        ,{\"@type\": \"Question\",\n        \n        \"name\": \"How do I reset the TextField material UI?\",\n        \n        \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \n        \"text\": \"\n\nIf you've ever worked with forms in web development, you know that one of the most annoying tasks can be clearing out form fields. This is especially true when you are using a JavaScript framework like React, since there is no built-in way to do this.\n\n Luckily, there is a simple solution. All you need to do is set the value of the field to an empty string. This can be done in a number of ways, but the easiest is to use the React setState function.\n\nFor example, if you have a text field with the name firstName, you can clear it like this:\n\nthis.setState({ firstName: '' });\n\nThis will update the state of the component and clear out the text field.\n\nOf course, you can also do this in a more general way. If you have an object with all of your form fields, you can loop through and set each one to an empty string.

Harsh cleaners can damage the paint, making it more difficult to clean in the future.  <br><br>A good way to test a cleaner is to apply it to a small section of the wall and see if it leaves any streaks or smears. \n\n Another important tip is to use a soft cloth when cleaning.

The answer is yes, clear quartz can go in water.  There are a few things to keep in mind, however.  <br><br>First, quartz is a natural absorbent, so it will absorb any impurities in the water.  Second, quartz is a soft mineral, so it can be scratched easily.  Be sure to use a soft cloth to avoid scratching the quartz.  <br><br>Finally, avoid using hot water, as it can cause the quartz to crack. </p>\n            <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n                                        <p></p>\n                                         <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->\n            <h2>Can quartz be put in water?</h2>\n            <!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n            <p>Yes, clear quartz can go in water.

This can be handy if you want to quickly replay a song you loved or share what you're listening to with a friend. But if you're not careful, your Recently Played list can quickly become a jumble of songs that you don't really care about.\n\nIf you're looking to clean up your Recently Played list, here's how to do it:\n\nFirst, open up Spotify and go to your Recently Played list, which is located on the main screen.\n\nNext\"\n\n        \n        }\n        }\n        ]\n        }\n        </script>\n        <!-- /wp:html -->\n    "

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to clean your Vornado fan so it will keep circulating fresh, clean air for years to come.\n\n1. Unplug the fan from the outlet and carefully remove any loose debris from the blades with your fingers.\n\n2.

The outer ear is the part that you can see, and it's the part that collects all the wax and debris.  <br><br>The middle ear is the part that contains your eardrum, and it's connected to your throat via the Eustachian tube.  And finally, the inner ear is the part that contains your balance organs and your hearing organs.\n\n The Eustachian tube is a small passageway that connects your middle ear to your throat.  <br><br>This tube is what helps to equalize the pressure in your ears.  </p>\n            <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->\n            <h2>However, if the coughing persists or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as pain or bleeding, it is important to see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions</h2>\n            <!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n            <p>It's not uncommon to cough when you clean your ears.

Additionally, contact solution can actually irritate a piercing and delay the healing process.\n\n So, what should you use to clean a piercing?  <br><br>The best thing to use is a saline solution.  You can purchase a pre-made saline solution at most pharmacies or online.  You can also make your own saline solution by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt with 1 cup of distilled water.  <br><br>Once you have your saline solution, simply soak a cotton ball in the solution and then gently clean the area around your piercing.\n\n Do this once or twice a day, or as needed, until your piercing has fully healed.  </p>\n            <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->\n            <h2>How can I care for my piercing after it has healed</h2>\n            <!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n            <p>If you have a bottle of contact solution lying around, you may be wondering if it can be used to clean your piercings.

However, it's important to use a saline solution, not a multipurpose solution that contains both saline and disinfectants.  <br><br>Contact solutions that contain disinfectants can actually delay the healing process. \n\n When you first get a piercing, you'll need to clean it several times a day to prevent infection.  A saline solution will help to remove any crusting or discharge from the piercing site.  <br><br>It's important to use a cotton swab or Q-tip, rather than a cotton ball, to avoid introducing new bacteria to the site.  Gently swirl the solution around the piercing, then let it air dry or use a clean cotton swab to remove any excess moisture. \n\n </p>\n            <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->\n            <h2>Can I change my own piercing jewelry</h2>\n            <!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n            <p>If you have ever had a piercing, you know that keeping it clean is incredibly important.  This is because piercings are basically open wounds and are therefore susceptible to infection.  One of the best ways to clean a piercing is to use contact lens solution. \n\n <br><br>This is because contact lens solution is specifically designed to clean things that come into contact with your eyes, which are much more sensitive than your skin.  In fact, using contact lens solution to clean your piercing is often recommended by piercers. \n\n To use contact lens solution to clean your piercing, simply soak a cotton ball in the solution and then use it to clean the area around your piercing.  <br><br>You can do this once or twice a day, or as needed.  Just make sure that you're using a new cotton ball each time. \n\n So, if you're looking for a way to keep your piercing clean, try using contact lens solution.  </p>\n            <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->\n            <h2>Where can I get my piercings done</h2>\n            <!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n            <p>If you have a piercing, it's important to keep the area clean to prevent infection.

You can purchase a pre-made saline solution at most pharmacies or online. You can also make your own saline solution by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt with 1 cup of distilled water. Once you have your saline solution, simply soak a cotton ball in the solution and then gently clean the area around your piercing.\n\nDo this once or twice a day, or as needed, until your piercing has fully healed.

The short answer is yes, contact solution is an effective way to clean new and healed piercings.

It's important to use a cotton swab or Q-tip, rather than a cotton ball, to avoid introducing new bacteria to the site.

In fact, using contact lens solution to clean your piercing is often recommended by piercers. \n\nTo use contact lens solution to clean your piercing, simply soak a cotton ball in the solution and then use it to clean the area around your piercing. You can do this once or twice a day, or as needed. Just make sure that you're using a new cotton ball each time. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a way to keep your piercing clean, try using contact lens solution.
